title: Upgrades
---

OpenZeppelin provides tooling for deploying and securing upgradeable smart contracts.

* [Upgrades Plugins](/upgrades-plugins) to deploy upgradeable contracts with automated security checks.
* [Upgradeable Contracts](/contracts/5.x/upgradeable) to build your contract using our Solidity components.

Find all of our resources related to upgradeability below.

If you don't know where to start we suggest to start with [**Learn: Upgrading Smart Contracts**](/contracts/5.x/learn/upgrading-smart-contracts).
