title: OpenZeppelin Contracts for Stylus
---

**A secure, modular smart contract library for [Stylus](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/gentle-introduction), written in Rust.**

OpenZeppelin Contracts for Stylus brings time-tested smart contract patterns to Arbitrum's WASM-based execution environment. This library provides `no_std`-compatible modules for building secure, reusable contracts in [Stylus](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/gentle-introduction).

## Features

* âœ¨ Security-first contracts ported from [`openzeppelin-contracts`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts).
* ðŸ“¦ Written in Rust with full `no_std` support.
* ðŸ§ª Tested with both unit and integration tests.
* ðŸš§ Actively developed.

## Quick Start

Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
openzeppelin-stylus = "=0.2.0"
```

Enable the ABI export feature:

```toml
[features]
export-abi = ["openzeppelin-stylus/export-abi"]
```

## Usage Example

A minimal ERC-20 implementation using the library:

```rust
use openzeppelin_stylus::token::erc20::self, Erc20, IErc20;
use stylus_sdk::
    alloy_primitives::{Address, U256,
    prelude::*,
};

#[entrypoint]
#[storage]
struct Erc20Example
    erc20: Erc20,


#[public]
#[implements(IErc20<Error = erc20::Error>)]
impl Erc20Example {}

#[public]
impl IErc20 for Erc20Example
    // ERC-20 logic implementation...

```

Explore more examples in the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/rust-contracts-stylus/tree/main/examples).

## Compatibility

This library is designed to work with `no_std`. To keep your contracts compatible, disable default features for any dependencies that pull in the standard library:

```toml
[dependencies]
alloy-primitives =  version = "=0.8.20", default-features = false
stylus-sdk = "=0.9.0"
```
