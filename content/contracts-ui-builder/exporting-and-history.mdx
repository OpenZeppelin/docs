title: Exporting and History
---

Once you have completed customizing your form it’s ready to ship! There are a few ways you can export and save previous UIs.

## Exporting

On the last step of the UI builder you can click the export button to download a zip file of your form as a VIte + React project.

After the download is complete, unzip the project and install dependencies and build the project.

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build
```

Once the build is complete run the dev server to see the form locally.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## History

As you use the Contracts UI Builder the app will store a local history of all the forms you’ve built which can be see in the sidebar.

By clicking on the three small dots you can rename, duplicate, download, or delete templates from your history. There is also the ability to backup and restore histories as JSON files by clicking on the `Download` button on the sidebar.
