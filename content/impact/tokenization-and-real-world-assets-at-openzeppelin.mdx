# Permissioned Tokens

Compliant issuance and management of institutional-grade digital assets

## Use Cases

### Tokenized Money Market Funds

Enable on-chain representation of yield-bearing traditional assets, allowing users and protocols to access stable, regulated returns.

### Payments

Facilitate instant, programmable settlement of real-world transactions using tokenized fiat or asset-backed instruments.

## Standards

### **ERC-3643: T-REX - Token for Regulated Exchanges (final)**

A [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3643) that enables the management and compliant transfer of institutional grade security tokens using on chain compliance and verification systems.

OpenZeppelin is building contracts libraries for confidential real world asset extensions in the [OpenZeppelin Confidential Contracts Repo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-confidential-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC7984/extensions).

### **ERC-7984: Confidential Fungible Token (draft)**

A [standard](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/1113/files#diff-4c22c7cb34e9622c46198c95e8810399c8bf545126ef800b3a464083629aa6e5) that enables confidential value transfer using a pointer based system.

OpenZeppelin co-authored the standard with Zama and is building contracts libraries in the [OpenZeppelin Confidential Contracts Repo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-confidential-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC7984).

### ERC-7943: Universal Real World Asset Interface (draft)

A [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7943) that enables compliance checks, transfer controls, and enforcement actions for Real World Assets (RWAs).

OpenZeppelin authored the standard and is building contracts libraries in the [OpenZeppelin Community Contracts Repo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-community-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20uRWA.sol).

## Associations

### **3643 Association**

The goal of the [association](https://www.erc3643.org/) is to increase the adoption of the 3643 token standard for real-world asset tokenization and on-chain compliance.

OpenZeppelin is a [member](https://www.erc3643.org/members) with many major organization.

# Tokenized Vaults

Management of yield-bearing assets and tokenized deposits.

## Use Cases

### Real World Asset Collateralization

Protocols can tokenize and collateralize underlying assets within vaults, supporting stablecoin pegs and capital efficiency through verifiable on-chain reserves.

### Lending and Borrowing

Deposited tokens can be supplied as liquidity to decentralized lending markets, enabling seamless borrowing and yield generation across interoperable vaults.

### Yield Aggregators

Aggregator protocols can integrate standardized vaults through a unified interface, allowing users to access diverse yield strategies and optimize returns.

## Standards

### **ERC-4626: Tokenized Vaults (final)**

A [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) that enables protocols and users to generate and manage yield for ERC-20 tokens.

OpenZeppelin has built libraries in the [OpenZeppelin contracts repo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts) and [OpenZeppelin community contracts repo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-community-contracts/tree/master/contracts).
