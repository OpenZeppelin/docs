title: A Decade of OpenZeppelin Contracts
---

For over ten years, OpenZeppelin Contracts has been the trusted foundation for the global smart contract ecosystem. What began as a pioneering open-source library has become the industry standard for secure, upgradeable, and interoperable on-chain systems.

Used by the world’s leading financial institutions, DeFi protocols, and blockchain networks, OpenZeppelin Contracts secures trillions in value and underpins the majority of deployments across networks. Our libraries remain the most widely adopted and continuously audited smart contract framework in the world.

Built and maintained by OpenZeppelin’s global engineering and security teams, the library embodies open collaboration, verifiable trust, and long-term reliability. Every line of code is battle-tested in production, reviewed by industry experts, and designed to evolve alongside emerging standards and regulatory frameworks.

## Expanding Ecosystem Coverage

OpenZeppelin Contracts powers secure smart contract development across the leading blockchain ecosystems and continues to be selected to develop contracts libraries for emerging ecosystems.
