title: Chain Abstraction at OpenZeppelin
---

OpenZeppelin is enabling seamless interoperability across chains and account systems. Our work focuses on building the secure primitives for cross-chain messaging, intent-based execution, and unified account experiences, creating a world where users and assets move freely across ecosystems with complexity abstracted away from users.

## Ecosystem Contributions

We have partnered with ecosystems and projects to deliver contracts libraries and tooling for cross-chain coordination and smart accounts.

## Cross-Chain Intents

Universal format for expressing and fulfilling user actions across chains.

### Use Cases

- **Simplified Onboarding to Chains and Apps**: Onboard users by automating gas, approvals, and cross chain setup, allowing users to interact with any app or network instantly without prior configuration.

- **Abstracted Gas and Settlement**: Allows operation across multiple chains without managing native gas tokens or complex bridge flows.

- **Token Bridging and Swapping**: Enable seamless asset transfers and swaps across chains, abstracting away bridge risks and fragmented liquidity.

- **Universal Balances**: Users can maintain a single cross chain balance, allowing applications to fetch, display, and transact from unified liquidity sources.

### Standards

- **ERC-7683: Cross Chain Intents** (draft): A [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7683) that enables cross chain value transfer using a standard api. OpenZeppelin is a contributor to and leading the redesign of the ERC through the [Open Intents Framework](https://www.openintents.xyz/The-Open-Intents-Framework-Intents-As-A-Public-Good-1976d35200d680fb8215f28775e067ec) and is building contracts libraries in the [Open Intents Framework Contracts Repo](https://github.com/openintentsframework/oif-contracts).

- **ERC-7888: Cross Chain Broadcaster** (draft): A [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7888) that enables cross chain messaging using storage proofs. OpenZeppelin is a contributor to the ERC through the [Open Intents Framework](https://www.openintents.xyz/The-Open-Intents-Framework-Intents-As-A-Public-Good-1976d35200d680fb8215f28775e067ec) and is building contracts libraries in the [Open Intents Framework Broadcaster Repo](https://github.com/openintentsframework/broadcaster).

### Associations

- **Open Intents Framework**: The [group](https://www.openintents.xyz/) is building a modular, open source framework for building and deploying intent product experiences by providing ready-to-use, protocol-agnostic features for solvers, interop providers, and cross-chain builders. OpenZeppelin is a [member](https://www.openintents.xyz/#1976d35200d68051bfe5f0bdb3ced9bc) with many major organizations.

## Cross-Chain Messaging

Common interface for sending and receiving messages across chains.

### Use Cases

- **State Synchronization for Multi-Chain Apps**: Use single controller contract or governance action to coordinate updates on multiple chains.

- **Token Bridges**: Enables verifiable message passing between bridge contracts, ensuring consistent state and transfer logic across multiple chains without relying on trusted intermediaries.

- **Intent Settlement**: Facilitates secure delivery and confirmation of intent execution results across chains, allowing applications to finalize actions and synchronize states.

### Standards

- **ERC-7786: Cross Chain Messaging Gateway** (last call): A [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7786) that enables cross-chain messaging via a universal gateway interface. OpenZeppelin co-authored the standard with Axelar and is building contracts libraries in the [OpenZeppelin Solidity Community Contracts Repo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-community-contracts/tree/master/contracts/crosschain).

## Smart Accounts

Composable architecture that enables customizable modules to support secure and extensible account functionality.

### Use Cases

- **Gasless Transactions**: Allow users to interact with apps without holding native tokens, enabling seamless onboarding.

- **Social Recovery**: Allow trusted guardians to securely restore access to accounts without centralized intermediaries.

- **Keyless Signatures**: Authenticate and approve transactions using biometrics, hardware modules, or passkeys instead of a traditional private key.

### Standards

- **ERC-4337: Account Abstraction Using Alt Mempool** (final): A [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) that enables account abstraction using an alternative mempool.

## Private Email Verification

Ownership of accounts using email.

### Use Cases

- **Send Crypto Using Only Email Address**: Users can authorize transactions (e.g. send money, DAO voting, any blockchain transaction) by proving control of their email address with no private key management required. Email never revealed!

- **Recover Account Using Email Gaurdians**: Lost keys can be restored by proving control of an email account, enabling user-friendly recovery.

### Standards

- **ERC-7969: DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Registry** (draft): A [standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7969) that enables trustless email ownership verification using a DKIM restistry.
