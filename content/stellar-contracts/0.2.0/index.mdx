title: Stellar Smart Contracts Suite
---

A comprehensive collection of secure, scalable smart contracts and utilities for the Stellar network,
supporting Fungible, Non-Fungible, and Multi-Token standards.

## Tokens
Explore our implementations for token standards on Stellar Soroban:

* ***[Fungible Tokens](/stellar-contracts/tokens/fungible)***: Digital assets representing a fixed or dynamic supply of identical units.
* ***[Non-Fungible Tokens](/stellar-contracts/tokens/non-fungible)***: Unique digital assets with verifiable ownership.
* ***Multi-Token***: Hybrid tokens enabling both fungible and non-fungible token functionalities (work in progress).

## Utilities
Discover our utility contracts for Stellar Soroban, applicable to all token standards mentioned above:

* ***[Pausable](/stellar-contracts/utils/pausable)***
* ***[Upgrades and Migrations](/stellar-contracts/upgradeable)***

## Error Codes
In Stellar Soroban, each error variant is assigned an integer. To prevent duplication of error codes,
we use the following convention:

* Utilities: `1XX`
  * Pausable: `10X`
  * Upgradeable: `11X`
  * any future utilities will continue from `12X`, `13X`, and so on.
* Fungible: `2XX`
* Non-Fungible: `3XX`
* Multi-Token: `4XX`
