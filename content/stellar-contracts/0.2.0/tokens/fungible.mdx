title: Fungible Token Standard
---

[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/fungible)

## Purpose

The Fungible Token Standard is a contract template designed to facilitate the creation and management of fungible tokens on the Stellar network.
It provides a flexible and secure framework for defining and managing token standards, enabling developers to create and manage tokens with ease.

## Extensions

We provide the below extensions to enhance the capabilities of the Fungible Token Standard.

### - Mintable
[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/fungible/src/extensions/mintable)

#### Summary
The `FungibleMintable` trait extends the `FungibleToken` trait to provide the capability to mint tokens.

#### Events
* `mint_event` :  broadcasted to the network when the `mint()` function is invoked.

### - Capped
[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/fungible/src/extensions/capped)

#### Summary
The `Capped` trait extends the `FungibleToken` trait to provide the capability to set a maximum supply for the token.

Note that the `Capped` trait is designed to be used in conjunction with the `Mintable` trait.

#### Events
There are no custom events associated with the `Capped` trait.

### - Burnable
[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/fungible/src/extensions/burnable)

#### Summary
The `FungibleBurnable` trait extends the `FungibleToken` trait to provide the
capability to burn tokens.

To fully comply with the SEP-41 specification one have to implement the
this `FungibleBurnable` trait along with the `[FungibleToken]` trait.
SEP-41 mandates support for token burning to be considered compliant.

Excluding the `burn` functionality from the `[FungibleToken]` trait
is a deliberate design choice to accommodate flexibility and customization
for various smart contract use cases.

#### Events
* `burn_event`: broadcasted to the network when the `burn()` or `burn_from()` function is invoked.

### - Metadata
[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/fungible/src/extensions/metadata)

#### Summary
Provides `setter` and `getter` methods for `symbol`, `name`, and `decimal` metadata information for your token.

#### Events
There are no custom events associated with the `Metadata` trait.

## Misc

To comply with the SEP-41 specification, a contract must implement both the `FungibleToken` and `FungibleBurnable`
traits. These traits together provide all the necessary methods to conform to `soroban_sdk::token::TokenInterface`,
offering another way to meet the SEP-41 requirements.

For contracts that implement both `FungibleToken` and `FungibleBurnable`,
and also need to implement `TokenInterface`, we provide the `impl_token_interface!` macro.
This macro automatically generates the required boilerplate, simplifying the implementation process.
