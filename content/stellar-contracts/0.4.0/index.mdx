title: Stellar Smart Contracts Suite
description: Stellar Smart Contracts Suite
---

A comprehensive collection of secure, scalable smart contracts and utilities for the Stellar network,
supporting Fungible, Non-Fungible, and Multi-Token standards.

## Tokens
Explore our implementations for token standards on Stellar Soroban:

* ***[Fungible Tokens](tokens/fungible/fungible.adoc)***: Digital assets representing a fixed or dynamic supply of identical units.
* ***[Non-Fungible Tokens](tokens/non-fungible/non-fungible.adoc)***: Unique digital assets with verifiable ownership.
* ***Multi-Token***: Hybrid tokens enabling both fungible and non-fungible token functionalities (work in progress).

## Utilities
Discover our utility contracts for Stellar Soroban, applicable to all token standards mentioned above:

* ***[Pausable](utils/pausable.adoc)***
* ***[Upgrades and Migrations](utils/upgradeable.adoc)***

## Error Codes
In Stellar Soroban, each error variant is assigned an integer. To prevent duplication of error codes,
we use the following convention:

* Fungible: `1XX`
* Non-Fungible: `2XX`
* Multi-Token: `3XX`

Any future tokens will continue from `4XX`, `5XX`, and so on.

* Utilities: `1XXX`
  * Pausable: `10XX`
  * Upgradeable: `11XX`
  * Access: `12XX`
    * Role Transfer (internal common module for 2-step role transfer): `120X`
    * Access Control: `121X`
    * Ownable: `122X`
  * Merkle Distributor: `13XX`

Any future utilities will continue from `14XX`, `15XX`, and so on.

## Important Notes
As a deliberate design choice, this library manages the TTL for temporary and persistent storage items.
To provide flexibility to the owner of the contract, this library deliberately does not manage the TTL for instance storage items.
It is the responsibility of the developer to manage the TTL for instance storage items.
