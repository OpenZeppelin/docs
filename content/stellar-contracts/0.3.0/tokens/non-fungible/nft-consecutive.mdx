title: Non-Fungible Consecutive
---

[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/non-fungible/src/extensions/consecutive)

Consecutive extension for [Non-Fungible Token](/stellar-contracts/0.3.0/tokens/non-fungible/non-fungible) is useful
for efficiently minting multiple tokens in a single transaction. This can significantly
reduce costs and improve performance when creating a large number of tokens at once.

## Usage

Weâ€™ll continue with the [example](/stellar-contracts/0.3.0/tokens/non-fungible/non-fungible#usage) from **Non-Fungible Token**
and modify the contract so that now batches of tokens can be minted with each call
to `award_items`. Please note any account can call `award_items` and we might want to
implement access control to restrict who can mint.

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Address, Env, String};
use stellar_default_impl_macro::default_impl;
use stellar_non_fungible::{
    consecutive::{Consecutive, NonFungibleConsecutive},
    Base, ContractOverrides, NonFungibleToken,
};

#[contract]
pub struct GameItem;

#[contractimpl]
impl GameItem {
    pub fn __constructor(e: &Env) {
        Base::set_metadata(
            e,
            String::from_str(e, "www.mygame.com"),
            String::from_str(e, "My Game Items Collection"),
            String::from_str(e, "MGMC"),
        );
    }

    pub fn award_items(e: &Env, to: Address, amount: u32) -> u32 {
        // access control might be needed
        Consecutive::batch_mint(e, &to, amount)
    }

    pub fn burn(e: &Env, from: Address, token_id: u32) {
        Consecutive::burn(e, &from, token_id);
    }
}

#[default_impl]
#[contractimpl]
impl NonFungibleToken for GameItem {
    type ContractType = Consecutive;
}

// no entry-point functions required, marker impl
impl NonFungibleConsecutive for GameItem {}
```
