[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/access/src/access-control)

## Overview

The Access Control module provides a comprehensive role-based access control system for Soroban contracts. It enables developers to manage permissions through a hierarchical role system, with a renounceable single overarching admin and customizable role assignments.

## Key Concepts

### Admin Management

The system features a single top-level admin with privileges to call any function in the `AccessControl` trait. This admin must be set during contract initialization for the module to function properly. This overarching admin can renounce themselves for decentralization purposes.

Admin transfers are implemented as a two-step process to prevent accidental or malicious takeovers:

1. The current admin **initiates** the transfer by specifying the new admin and an expiration time (`live_until_ledger`).
2. The designated new admin must **explicitly accept** the transfer to complete it.

Until the transfer is accepted, the original admin retains full control and can override or cancel the transfer by initiating a new one or using a `live_until_ledger` of `0`.

### Role Hierarchy

The module supports a hierarchical role system where each role can have an "admin role" assigned to it. For example:

* Create roles `minter` and `minter_admin`
* Assign `minter_admin` as the admin role for the `minter` role
* Accounts with the `minter_admin` role can grant/revoke the `minter` role to other accounts

This allows for creating complex organizational structures with chains of command and delegated authority.

#### Setting Up Role Hierarchies

Here's how to establish and use role hierarchies in practice:

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, symbol_short, Address, Env};
use stellar_access::access_control::{self as access_control, AccessControl};

#[contract]
pub struct MyContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl MyContract {
    pub fn __constructor(e: &Env, admin: Address) {
        // Set the contract admin
        access_control::set_admin(e, &admin);
        
        // Define role hierarchy: MANAGER_ROLE can manage USER_ROLE
        let manager_role = symbol_short!("manager");
        let user_role = symbol_short!("user");
        
        // Set MANAGER_ROLE as the admin role for USER_ROLE
        access_control::set_role_admin(e, &admin, &user_role, &manager_role);
    }
    
    pub fn setup_roles(e: &Env, admin: Address, manager: Address, user: Address) {
        let manager_role = symbol_short!("manager");
        let user_role = symbol_short!("user");
        
        // Admin grants MANAGER_ROLE to the manager account
        access_control::grant_role(e, &admin, &manager, &manager_role);
        
        // Now the manager can grant USER_ROLE to other accounts
        access_control::grant_role(e, &manager, &user, &user_role);
        
        // Manager can also revoke USER_ROLE
        access_control::revoke_role(e, &manager, &user, &user_role);
    }
}
```

In this example:
1. The contract admin sets `manager` as the admin role for `user` using `set_role_admin()`
2. The admin grants the `manager` role to a manager account
3. The manager can now grant/revoke the `user` role to other accounts without requiring admin intervention

### Role Enumeration

The system tracks account-role pairs in storage with additional enumeration logic:

* When a role is granted to an account, the pair is stored and added to enumeration storage
* When a role is revoked, the pair is removed from storage and enumeration
* If all accounts are removed from a role, the helper storage items become empty or 0

Roles exist only through their relationships with accounts, so a role with zero accounts is indistinguishable from a role that never existed.

## Procedural Macros

The module includes several procedural macros to simplify authorization checks in your contract functions. These macros are divided into two categories:

### Authorization-Enforcing Macros

These macros automatically call `require_auth()` on the specified account before executing the function:

#### @only_admin

Restricts access to the contract admin only:

```rust
#[only_admin]
pub fn admin_function(e: &Env) {
    // Only the admin can call this function
    // require_auth() is automatically called
}
```

#### @only_role

Restricts access to accounts with a specific role:

```rust
#[only_role(caller, "minter")]
pub fn mint(e: &Env, caller: Address, to: Address, token_id: u32) {
    // Only accounts with the "minter" role can call this
    // require_auth() is automatically called on caller
}
```

#### @only_any_role

Restricts access to accounts with any of the specified roles:

```rust
#[only_any_role(caller, ["minter", "burner"])]
pub fn multi_role_action(e: &Env, caller: Address) {
    // Accounts with either "minter" or "burner" role can call this
    // require_auth() is automatically called on caller
}
```

### Role-Checking Macros

These macros check role membership but do **not** enforce authorization. You must manually call `require_auth()` if needed:

#### @has_role

Checks if an account has a specific role:

```rust
#[has_role(caller, "minter")]
pub fn conditional_mint(e: &Env, caller: Address, to: Address, token_id: u32) {
    // Checks if caller has "minter" role, but doesn't call require_auth()
    caller.require_auth(); // Must manually authorize if needed
}
```

#### @has_any_role

Checks if an account has any of the specified roles:

```rust
#[has_any_role(caller, ["minter", "burner"])]
pub fn multi_role_check(e: &Env, caller: Address) {
    // Checks if caller has either role, but doesn't call require_auth()
    caller.require_auth(); // Must manually authorize if needed
}
```

## Usage Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using the Access Control module:

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, symbol_short, Address, Env};
use stellar_access::access_control::{self as access_control, AccessControl};
use stellar_macros::{has_role, only_admin};

#[contract]
pub struct MyContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl MyContract {
    pub fn __constructor(e: &Env, admin: Address) {
        // Set the contract admin
        access_control::set_admin(e, &admin);

        // Create a "minter" role with admin as its admin
        access_control::set_role_admin_no_auth(e, &symbol_short!("minter"), &symbol_short!("admin"));
    }


    #[only_admin]
    pub fn admin_restricted_function(e: &Env) -> Vec<String> {
        vec![&e, String::from_str(e, "seems sus")]
    }


    // we want `require_auth()` provided by the macro, since there is no
    // `require_auth()` in `Base::mint`.
    #[only_role(caller, "minter")]
    pub fn mint(e: &Env, caller: Address, to: Address, token_id: u32) {
        Base::mint(e, &to, token_id)

    }


    // allows either minter or burner role, does not enforce `require_auth` in the macro
    #[has_any_role(caller, ["minter", "burner"])]
    pub fn multi_role_action(e: &Env, caller: Address) -> String {
        caller.require_auth();
        String::from_str(e, "multi_role_action_success")
    }


    // allows either minter or burner role AND enforces `require_auth` in the macro
    #[only_any_role(caller, ["minter", "burner"])]
    pub fn multi_role_auth_action(e: &Env, caller: Address) -> String {

        String::from_str(e, "multi_role_auth_action_success")
    }
}
```
