title: Stellar Smart Contracts Suite
---

Explore our comprehensive suite of secure and scalable smart contract utilities for Stellar Soroban. Our libraries provide robust implementations for fungible and non-fungible tokens, along with powerful tools for access control and contract management.

## Tokens

*   **[Fungible Tokens](/stellar-contracts/tokens/fungible/fungible)**: Digital assets representing a fixed or dynamic supply of identical units.
*   **[Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)](/stellar-contracts/tokens/non-fungible/non-fungible)**: Unique digital assets with verifiable ownership.

## Access Control

*   **[Ownable](/stellar-contracts/access/ownable)**: A simple mechanism with a single account authorized for all privileged actions.
*   **[Role-Based Access Control](/stellar-contracts/access/access-control)**: A flexible mechanism with distinct roles for each privileged action.

## Utilities

*   **[Pausable](/stellar-contracts/utils/pausable)**: Pause and unpause contract functions, useful for emergency response.
*   **[Upgradeable](/stellar-contracts/utils/upgradeable)**: Manage contract upgrades and data migrations seamlessly.
*   **[Cryptography](/stellar-contracts/utils/crypto)**: A set of cryptographic primitives and utilities for Soroban contracts.

## Security and Audits

Our contracts are built with security as a top priority. You can find our audit reports [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/audits).

## Error Codes
In Stellar Soroban, each error variant is assigned an integer. To prevent duplication of error codes,
we use the following convention:

* Fungible: `1XX`
* Non-Fungible: `2XX`
* RWA: `3XX`
* Vault: `4XX`

Any future tokens will continue from `5XX`, `6XX`, and so on.

Similarly, utilities and other modules have their own error codes:

* Utilities: `1XXX`
  * Pausable: `10XX`
  * Upgradeable: `11XX`
  * Merkle Distributor: `13XX`
  * Crypto: `14XX`
  * Math: `15XX`
* Access: `2XXX`
  * Access Control: `20XX`
  * Ownable: `21XX`
  * Role Transfer (internal common module for 2-step role transfer): `22XX`
* Accounts: `3XXX`

## Important Notes
As a deliberate design choice, this library manages the TTL for temporary and persistent storage items.
To provide flexibility to the owner of the contract, this library deliberately does not manage the TTL for instance storage items.
It is the responsibility of the developer to manage the TTL for instance storage items.
