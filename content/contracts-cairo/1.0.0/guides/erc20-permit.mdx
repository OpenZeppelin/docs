title: ERC20Permit
---

The [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) standard, commonly referred to as ERC20Permit, is designed to support gasless token approvals. This is achieved with an off-chain
signature following the [SNIP12](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-12.md) standard, rather than with an on-chain transaction. The [permit](/api/erc20#ERC20Component-permit) function verifies the signature and sets
the spenderâ€™s allowance if the signature is valid. This approach improves user experience and reduces gas costs.

## Differences from Solidity

Although this extension is mostly similar to the [Solidity implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Permit.sol) of [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612), there are some notable differences in the parameters of the [permit](/api/erc20#ERC20Component-permit) function:

* The `deadline` parameter is represented by `u64` rather than `u256`.
* The `signature` parameter is represented by a span of felts rather than `v`, `r`, and `s` values.

<Callout>
Unlike Solidity, there is no enforced format for signatures on Starknet. A signature is represented by an array or span of felts,
and there is no universal method for validating signatures of unknown formats. Consequently, a signature provided to the [permit](/api/erc20#ERC20Component-permit) function
is validated through an external `is_valid_signature` call to the contract at the `owner` address.
</Callout>

## Usage

The functionality is provided as an embeddable [ERC20Permit](/api/erc20#ERC20Component-Embeddable-Impls-ERC20PermitImpl) trait of the [ERC20Component](/api/erc20#ERC20Component).

```cairo
#[abi(embed_v0)]
impl ERC20PermitImpl = ERC20Component::ERC20PermitImpl<ContractState>;
```

A contract must meet the following requirements to be able to use the [ERC20Permit](/api/erc20#ERC20Component-Embeddable-Impls-ERC20PermitImpl) trait:

* Implement [ERC20Component](/api/erc20#ERC20Component).
* Implement [NoncesComponent](/api/utilities#NoncesComponent).
* Implement [SNIP12Metadata](api/utilities#snip12) trait (used in signature generation).

## Typed message

To safeguard against replay attacks and ensure the uniqueness of each approval via [permit](/api/erc20#ERC20Component-permit), the data signed includes:

* The address of the `owner`.
* The parameters specified in the [permit](/api/erc20#ERC20Component-approve) function (`spender` and `amount`)
* The address of the `token` contract itself.
* A `nonce`, which must be unique for each operation.
* The `chain_id`, which protects against cross-chain replay attacks.

The format of the `Permit` structure in a signed permit message is as follows:
```cairo
struct Permit {
    token: ContractAddress,
    spender: ContractAddress,
    amount: u256,
    nonce: felt252,
    deadline: u64,
}
```

<Callout>
The owner of the tokens is also part of the signed message. It is used as the `signer` parameter in the `get_message_hash` call.
</Callout>

Further details on preparing and signing a typed message can be found in the [SNIP12 guide](/guides/snip12).
