title: Merkle Tree
---

import { UMBRELLA_VERSION } from "../utils/constants.ts";

This crate provides a set of utilities for verifying Merkle Tree proofs on-chain. The tree and the proofs can be generated using this [JavaScript library](https://github.com/ericnordelo/strk-merkle-tree).

This module provides:

- `verify` - can prove that some value is part of a Merkle tree.
- `verify_multi_proof` - can prove multiple values are part of a Merkle tree.

`openzeppelin_merkle_tree` doesn’t have dependencies outside of `corelib`, and can be used in projects that are not Starknet-related.

To use it as a standalone package, you can add it in your `Scarb.toml` as follows:

`openzeppelin_merkle_tree = "3.0.0-alpha.1"`

<APIGithubLinkHeader moduleName="merkle_proof" link={`https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/${UMBRELLA_VERSION}/packages/merkle_tree/src/merkle_proof.cairo`} />

```rust
use openzeppelin_merkle_tree::merkle_proof;
```

These functions deal with verification of Merkle Tree proofs.

The tree and the proofs can be generated using this [JavaScript library](https://github.com/ericnordelo/strk-merkle-tree). You will find a quickstart guide in the readme.

You should avoid using leaf values that are two felt252 values long prior to hashing, or use a hash function other than the one used to hash internal nodes for hashing leaves. This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in the Merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value. The JavaScript library generates Merkle trees that are safe against this attack out of the box.

<APIItem
  functionSignature="verify<+CommutativeHasher>(proof: Span<felt252>, root: felt252, leaf: felt252) → bool"
  id="merkle_proof-verify"
  kind="public"
>
Returns true if a `leaf` can be proved to be a part of a Merkle tree defined by `root`.

For this, a `proof` must be provided, containing sibling hashes on the branch from the leaf to the root of the tree.

Each pair of leaves and each pair of pre-images are assumed to be sorted.

This function expects a `CommutativeHasher` implementation. See [hashes::CommutativeHasher](#hashes-CommutativeHasher) for more information.

`verify_pedersen` and `verify_poseidon` already include the corresponding `Hasher` implementations.

  functionSignature="process_proof<+CommutativeHasher>(proof: Span<felt252>, leaf: felt252) → felt252"
  id="merkle_proof-process_proof"
  kind="public"
>
Returns the rebuilt hash obtained by traversing a Merkle tree up from `leaf` using `proof`.

A `proof` is valid if and only if the rebuilt hash matches the root of the tree.

When processing the proof, the pairs of leaves &amp; pre-images are assumed to be sorted.

This function expects a `CommutativeHasher` implementation. See [hashes::CommutativeHasher](#hashes-CommutativeHasher) for more information.
</APIItem>

<APIItem
  functionSignature="verify_multi_proof<+CommutativeHasher>(proof: Span<felt252>, proof_flags: Span<bool>, root: felt252, leaves: Span<felt252>) → bool"
  id="merkle_proof-verify_multi_proof"
  kind="public"
>
Returns true if the `leaves` can be simultaneously proven to be a part of a Merkle tree defined by `root`, according to `proof` and `proof_flags` as described in `process_multi_proof`.

The `leaves` must be validated independently.

Not all Merkle trees admit multiproofs. See `process_multi_proof` for details.

Consider the case where `root == proof.at(0) && leaves.len() == 0` as it will return `true`.

This function expects a `CommutativeHasher` implementation. See [hashes::CommutativeHasher](#hashes-CommutativeHasher) for more information.
</APIItem>

<APIItem
  functionSignature="process_multi_proof<+CommutativeHasher>(proof: Span<felt252>, proof_flags: Span<bool>, leaves: Span<felt252>) → felt252"
  id="merkle_proof-process_multi_proof"
  kind="public"
>
Returns the root of a tree reconstructed from `leaves` and sibling nodes in `proof`.

The reconstruction proceeds by incrementally reconstructing all inner nodes by combining a leaf/inner node with either another leaf/inner node or a proof sibling node, depending on whether each `proof_flags` item is true or false respectively.

Not all Merkle trees admit multiproofs. To use multiproofs, it is sufficient to ensure that:

1. The tree is complete (but not necessarily perfect).
2. The leaves to be proven are in the opposite order than they are in the tree. (i.e., as seen from right to left starting at the deepest layer and continuing at the next layer).

The *empty set* (i.e. the case where `proof.len() == 1 && leaves.len() == 0`) is considered a no-op, and therefore a valid multiproof (i.e. it returns `proof.at(0)`). Consider disallowing this case if you're not validating the leaves elsewhere.

This function expects a `CommutativeHasher` implementation. See [hashes::CommutativeHasher](#hashes-CommutativeHasher) for more information.

Module providing the trait and default implementations for the commutative hash functions used in [`merkle_proof`](#merkle_proof).

The `PedersenCHasher` implementation matches the default node hashing function used in the [JavaScript library](https://github.com/ericnordelo/strk-merkle-tree).

#### [](#hashes-Traits)Traits [!toc]

<APIItem
  functionSignature="CommutativeHasher trait"
  id="hashes-CommutativeHasher"
  kind="trait"
>
Declares a commutative hash function with the following signature:

`commutative_hash(a: felt252, b: felt252) → felt252;`

which computes a commutative hash of a sorted pair of felt252 values.

This is usually implemented as an extension of a non-commutative hash function, like Pedersen or Poseidon, returning the hash of the concatenation of the two values by first sorting them.

Frequently used when working with merkle proofs.

The `commutative_hash` function MUST follow the invariant that `commutative_hash(a, b) == commutative_hash(b, a)`.

<APIItem
  functionSignature="PedersenCHasher impl"
  id="hashes-PedersenCHasher"
  kind="impl"
>
Implementation of the `CommutativeHasher` trait which computes the Pedersen hash of chaining the two input values with the len (2), sorting the pair first.
