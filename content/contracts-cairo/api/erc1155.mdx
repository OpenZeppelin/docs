#### [](#ERC1155Component-Hooks)Hooks

Hooks are functions which implementations can extend the functionality of the component source code. Every contract using ERC1155Component is expected to provide an implementation of the ERC1155HooksTrait. For basic token contracts, an empty implementation with no logic must be provided.

You can use `openzeppelin_token::erc1155::ERC1155HooksEmptyImpl` which is already available as part of the library for this purpose.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-before_update)`before_update(ref self: ContractState, from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, token_ids: Span<u256>, values: Span<u256>)` hook

Function executed at the beginning of the [update](#ERC1155Component-update) function prior to any other logic.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-after_update)`after_update(ref self: ContractState, from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, token_ids: Span<u256>, values: Span<u256>)` hook

Function executed at the end of the [update](#ERC1155Component-update) function.

#### [](#embeddable_functions)Embeddable functions

#### [](#ERC1155Component-balance_of)`balance_of(self: @ContractState, account: ContractAddress, token_id: u256) → u256` external

Returns the amount of `token_id` tokens owned by `account`.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-balance_of_batch)`balance_of_batch(self: @ContractState, accounts: Span<ContractAddress>, token_ids: Span<u256>) → Span<u256>` external

Returns a list of balances derived from the `accounts` and `token_ids` pairs.

Requirements:

- `token_ids` and `accounts` must have the same length.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-safe_transfer_from)`safe_transfer_from(ref self: ContractState, from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, token_id: u256, value: u256, data: Span<felt252>)` external

Transfers ownership of `value` amount of `token_id` from `from` if `to` is either an account or `IERC1155Receiver`.

`data` is additional data, it has no specified format and it is passed to `to`.

This function can potentially allow a reentrancy attack when transferring tokens to an untrusted contract, when invoking `on_ERC1155_received` on the receiver. Ensure to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern and consider employing reentrancy guards when interacting with untrusted contracts.

Requirements:

- Caller is either approved or the `token_id` owner.
- `from` is not the zero address.
- `to` is not the zero address.
- If `to` refers to a non-account contract, it must implement `IERC1155Receiver::on_ERC1155_received` and return the required magic value.

Emits a [TransferSingle](#ERC1155Component-TransferSingle) event.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-safe_batch_transfer_from)`safe_batch_transfer_from(ref self: ContractState, from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, token_ids: Span<u256>, values: Span<u256>, data: Span<felt252>)` external

Transfers ownership of `values` and `token_ids` pairs from `from` if `to` is either an account or `IERC1155Receiver`.

`data` is additional data, it has no specified format and it is passed to `to`.

This function can potentially allow a reentrancy attack when transferring tokens to an untrusted contract, when invoking `on_ERC1155_batch_received` on the receiver. Ensure to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern and consider employing reentrancy guards when interacting with untrusted contracts.

Requirements:

- Caller is either approved or the `token_id` owner.
- `from` is not the zero address.
- `to` is not the zero address.
- `token_ids` and `values` must have the same length.
- If `to` refers to a non-account contract, it must implement `IERC1155Receiver::on_ERC1155_batch_received` and return the acceptance magic value.

Emits a [TransferSingle](#ERC1155Component-TransferSingle) event if the arrays contain one element, and [TransferBatch](#ERC1155Component-TransferBatch) otherwise.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-set_approval_for_all)`set_approval_for_all(ref self: ContractState, operator: ContractAddress, approved: bool)` external

Enables or disables approval for `operator` to manage all of the callers assets.

Requirements:

- `operator` cannot be the caller.

Emits an [ApprovalForAll](#ERC1155Component-ApprovalForAll) event.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-is_approved_for_all)`is_approved_for_all(self: @ContractState, owner: ContractAddress, operator: ContractAddress) -> bool` external

Queries if `operator` is an authorized operator for `owner`.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-uri)`uri(self: @ContractState, token_id: u256) -> ByteArray` external

This implementation returns the same URI for **all** token types. It relies on the token type ID substitution mechanism [specified in the EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#metadata).

Clients calling this function must replace the `id` substring with the actual token type ID.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-balanceOf)`balanceOf(self: @ContractState, account: ContractAddress, tokenId: u256) → u256` external

See [ERC1155Component::balance\_of](#ERC1155Component-balance_of).

#### [](#ERC1155Component-balanceOfBatch)`balanceOfBatch(self: @ContractState, accounts: Span<ContractAddress>, tokenIds: Span<u256>) → Span<u256>` external

See [ERC1155Component::balance\_of\_batch](#ERC1155Component-balance_of_batch).

#### [](#ERC1155Component-safeTransferFrom)`safeTransferFrom(ref self: ContractState, from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, tokenId: u256, value: u256, data: Span<felt252>)` external

See [ERC1155Component::safe\_transfer\_from](#ERC1155Component-safe_transfer_from).

#### [](#ERC1155Component-safeBatchTransferFrom)`safeBatchTransferFrom(ref self: ContractState, from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, tokenIds: Span<u256>, values: Span<u256>, data: Span<felt252>)` external

See [ERC1155Component::safe\_batch\_transfer\_from](#ERC1155Component-safe_batch_transfer_from).

#### [](#ERC1155Component-setApprovalForAll)`setApprovalForAll(ref self: ContractState, operator: ContractAddress, approved: bool)` external

See [ERC1155Component::set\_approval\_for\_all](#ERC1155Component-set_approval_for_all).

#### [](#ERC1155Component-isApprovedForAll)`isApprovedForAll(self: @ContractState, owner: ContractAddress, operator: ContractAddress) -> bool` external

See [ERC1155Component::is\_approved\_for\_all](#ERC1155Component-is_approved_for_all).

#### [](#internal_functions)Internal functions

#### [](#ERC1155Component-initializer)`initializer(ref self: ContractState, base_uri: ByteArray)` internal

Initializes the contract by setting the token’s base URI as `base_uri`, and registering the supported interfaces. This should only be used inside the contract’s constructor.

Most ERC1155 contracts expose the [IERC1155MetadataURI](#IERC1155MetadataURI) interface which is what this initializer is meant to support. If the contract DOES NOT expose the [IERC1155MetadataURI](#IERC1155MetadataURI) interface, meaning tokens do not have a URI, the contract must instead use [initializer\_no\_metadata](#ERC1155Component-initializer_no_metadata) in the constructor. Failure to abide by these instructions can lead to unexpected issues especially with UIs.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-initializer_no_metadata)`initializer_no_metadata(ref self: ContractState)` internal

Initializes the contract with no metadata by registering only the IERC1155 interface.

This initializer should ONLY be used during construction in the very specific instance when the contract does NOT expose the [IERC1155MetadataURI](#IERC1155MetadataURI) interface. Initializing a contract with this initializer means that tokens will not have a URI.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-mint_with_acceptance_check)`mint_with_acceptance_check(ref self: ContractState, to: ContractAddress, token_id: u256, value: u256, data: Span<felt252>)` internal

Creates a `value` amount of tokens of type `token_id`, and assigns them to `to`.

Requirements:

- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement `IERC1155Receiver::on_ERC1155_received` and return the acceptance magic value.

Emits a [TransferSingle](#ERC1155Component-TransferSingle) event.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-batch_mint_with_acceptance_check)`batch_mint_with_acceptance_check(ref self: ContractState, to: ContractAddress, token_ids: Span<u256>, values: Span<u256>, data: Span<felt252>)` internal

Batched version of [mint\_with\_acceptance\_check](#ERC1155Component-mint_with_acceptance_check).

Requirements:

- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `token_ids` and `values` must have the same length.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement `IERC1155Receiver::on_ERC1155_batch_received` and return the acceptance magic value.

Emits a [TransferBatch](#ERC1155Component-TransferBatch) event.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-burn)`burn(ref self: ContractState, from: ContractAddress, token_id: u256, value: u256)` internal

Destroys a `value` amount of tokens of type `token_id` from `from`.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `from` must have at least `value` amount of tokens of type `token_id`.

Emits a [TransferSingle](#ERC1155Component-TransferSingle) event.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-batch_burn)`batch_burn(ref self: ContractState, from: ContractAddress, token_ids: Span<u256>, values: Span<u256>)` internal

Batched version of [burn](#ERC1155Component-burn).

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `from` must have at least `value` amount of tokens of type `token_id`.
- `token_ids` and `values` must have the same length.

Emits a [TransferBatch](#ERC1155Component-TransferBatch) event.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-update_with_acceptance_check)`update_with_acceptance_check(ref self: ContractState, from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, token_ids: Span<u256>, values: Span<u256>, data: Span<felt252>)` internal

Version of `update` that performs the token acceptance check by calling `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` in the receiver if it implements `IERC1155Receiver`, otherwise by checking if it is an account.

Requirements:

- `to` is either an account contract or supports the `IERC1155Receiver` interface.
- `token_ids` and `values` must have the same length.

Emits a [TransferSingle](#ERC1155Component-TransferSingle) event if the arrays contain one element, and [TransferBatch](#ERC1155Component-TransferBatch) otherwise.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-update)`update(ref self: ContractState, from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, token_ids: Span<u256>, values: Span<u256>)` internal

Transfers a `value` amount of tokens of type `id` from `from` to `to`. Will mint (or burn) if `from` (or `to`) is the zero address.

Requirements:

- `token_ids` and `values` must have the same length.

Emits a [TransferSingle](#ERC1155Component-TransferSingle) event if the arrays contain one element, and [TransferBatch](#ERC1155Component-TransferBatch) otherwise.

This function can be extended using the [ERC1155HooksTrait](#ERC1155Component-ERC1155HooksTrait), to add functionality before and/or after the transfer, mint, or burn.

The ERC1155 acceptance check is not performed in this function. See [update\_with\_acceptance\_check](#ERC1155Component-update_with_acceptance_check) instead.

#### [](#ERC1155Component-_set_base_uri)`_set_base_uri(ref self: ContractState, base_uri: ByteArray)` internal

Sets a new URI for all token types, by relying on the token type ID substitution mechanism [specified in the EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#metadata).

By this mechanism, any occurrence of the `id` substring in either the URI or any of the values in the JSON file at said URI will be replaced by clients with the token type ID.

For example, the `https://token-cdn-domain/\id\.json` URI would be interpreted by clients as `https://token-cdn-domain/000000000000...000000000000004cce0.json` for token type ID `0x4cce0`.

Because these URIs cannot be meaningfully represented by the `URI` event, this function emits no events.

#### [](#ERC1155Upgradeable-constructor)`constructor(ref self: ContractState, base_uri: ByteArray, recipient: ContractAddress, token_ids: Span<u256>, values: Span<u256>, owner: ContractAddress)` constructor

Sets the `base_uri` for all tokens and registers the supported interfaces. Mints the `values` for `token_ids` tokens to `recipient`. Assigns `owner` as the contract owner with permissions to upgrade.

Requirements:

- `to` is either an account contract (supporting ISRC6) or supports the `IERC1155Receiver` interface.
- `token_ids` and `values` must have the same length.

#### [](#ERC1155Upgradeable-external-functions)External Functions

#### [](#ERC1155Upgradeable-upgrade)`upgrade(ref self: ContractState, new_class_hash: ClassHash)` external

Upgrades the contract to a new implementation given by `new_class_hash`.

Requirements:

- The caller is the contract owner.
- `new_class_hash` cannot be zero.
