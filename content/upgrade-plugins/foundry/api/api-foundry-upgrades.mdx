## Contract name formats

Contract names must be provided in specific formats depending on context. The following are the required formats for each context:

### Foundry artifact format

Contexts:

* `contractName` parameter
* `referenceContract` option if `referenceBuildInfoDir` option is not set

Can be in any of the following forms according to Foundryâ€™s [getCode](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/get-code) cheatcode:

* the Solidity file name, e.g. `ContractV1.sol`
* the Solidity file name and the contract name, e.g. `ContractV1.sol:ContractV1`
* the artifact path relative to the project root directory, e.g. `out/ContractV1.sol/ContractV1.json`

### Annotation format

Contexts:

* `@custom:oz-upgrades-from <reference>` annotation
* `referenceContract` option if `referenceBuildInfoDir` option is set

Can be in any of the following forms according to the [OpenZeppelin Upgrades CLI](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/api-core#define-reference-contracts):

* the contract name, e.g. `ContractV1`
* fully qualified contract name, e.g. `contracts/tokens/ContractV1.sol:ContractV1`

If the `referenceBuildInfoDir` option is set, include the build info directory short name as a prefix, resulting in one of the following forms:

* the build info directory short name and the contract name, e.g. `build-info-v1:ContractV1`
* the build info directory short name and the fully qualified contract name, e.g. `build-info-v1:contracts/tokens/ContractV1.sol:ContractV1`

## Common Options

The following options can be used with some of the below functions. See [Options.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-foundry-upgrades/blob/main/src/Options.sol) for detailed descriptions of each option.
