Contracts Wizard is a web application to interactively build a contract out of components from OpenZeppelin Contracts. Select the kind of contract that you want, set your parameters and desired features, and the Wizard will generate all of the code necessary. The resulting code is ready to be compiled and deployed, or it can serve as a starting point and customized further with application specific logic.

## Usage

Use the Contracts Wizard here in the docs or at [wizard.openzeppelin.com](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com)

## TypeScript API

You can use the programmatic TypeScript API to generate contracts from your own applications.

View the API documentation for each smart contract language:
- [Solidity](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/contracts-wizard/blob/master/packages/core/solidity/README.md)
- [Cairo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/contracts-wizard/blob/master/packages/core/cairo/README.md)
- [Stellar](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/contracts-wizard/blob/master/packages/core/stellar/README.md)
- [Stylus](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/contracts-wizard/blob/master/packages/core/stylus/README.md)

## Embedding

To embed Contracts Wizard on your site, first include the script tag:

```html
<script async src="https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/build/embed.js"></script>
```

Then place `<oz-wizard></oz-wizard>` in the body where you want Contracts Wizard to load.

Optionally focus on specific tab with the `data-tab` attribute as in `<oz-wizard data-tab="ERC721"></oz-wizard>`.

For languages other than Solidity, use the `data-lang` attribute, for example: `<oz-wizard data-lang="cairo"></oz-wizard>`.
