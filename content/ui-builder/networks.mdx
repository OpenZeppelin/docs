## Network Configs

Each network can be configured to use custom RPCs, Explorers, and Explorer APIs. To open the network configuration modal, click on the settings icon on the right side of a network.

In this modal you can configure a custom RPC URL which can include path API key authorization

Under the explorer tab you can configure block explorers like Etherscan. By default the Contracts UI Builder uses public APIs that can be rate limited, so be sure to provide your own API key if that becomes an issue.

You can also toggle advance settings to use a custom block explorer setup.
