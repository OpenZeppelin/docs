The Contracts UI Builder is an open source tool you can quickly create online forms to interact with your smart contracts for testing or for administration purposes. It includes a vast amount of features including:

* Configurable EVM Networks
* Automatic contract state and ABI scraping
* Custom forms to handle different types of contract inputs and functions
* Execution restriction options
* OpenZeppelin Wallet UI or Rainbow Kit
* Export as React App project

## Getting Started

### 1. Select Network

First select the network your contract is deployed to

### 2. Provide Contract Address

Paste in the contract address and the UI Builder will fetch the ABI if the contract is verified. If it is not verified then provide the ABI in the form.
