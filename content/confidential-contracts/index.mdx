title: Confidential Contracts
---

A library of smart contracts that use ciphertext for amount, allowing for a wide variety of confidential use-cases, such as confidential tokens, auctions, vesting, voting etc. While the contracts are not written in an opinionated method (other than using the standard encrypted values published by Zama), for testing and examples in the documentation, the [Zama fhEVM](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-solidity) will be used to operate on and decrypt [FHE](https://www.zama.ai/introduction-to-homomorphic-encryption) ciphertext.

<Callout>
All contracts must set their respective co-processor configuration during construction (or initialization). This can be done automatically by inheriting contracts in [`ZamaConfig`](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/v0.7.12/library-solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol#L47-L73).

## Security

Contracts in the confidential contracts library are provided as is, with no particular guarantees. Given changes in this repository are more frequent, the code is not formally audited and not covered by the [bug bounty program on Immunefi](https://www.immunefi.com/bounty/openzeppelin).

Similarly, the code has no backward compatibility guarantees.

We kindly ask to report any issue directly to our security mailto:security@openzeppelin.org[contact]. The team will do its best to assist and mitigate any potential misuses of the library. However, keep in mind the flexibility assumed for this repository may relax our assessment.
