title: Account Modules
---

Smart accounts built with [ERC-7579](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579) provide a standardized way to extend account functionality through modules (i.e. smart contract instances). This architecture allows accounts to support various features that are compatible with a wide variety of account implementations. See [compatible modules](https://erc7579.com/modules).

## ERC-7579

ERC-7579 defines a standardized interface for modular smart accounts. This standard enables accounts to install, uninstall, and interact with modules that extend their capabilities in a composable manner with different account implementations.

### Accounts

OpenZeppelin offers an implementation of an [`AccountERC7579`](/community-contracts/api/account#AccountERC7579) contract that allows installing modules compliant with this standard. There’s also an [`AccountERC7579Hooked`](/community-contracts/api/account#AccountERC7579Hooked) variant that supports installation of hooks. Like [most accounts](accounts#handling_initialization), an instance should define an initializer function where the first module that controls the account will be set:

<include cwd lang='solidity'>./examples/account/MyAccountERC7579.sol</include>

<Callout>
For simplicity, the [`AccountERC7579Hooked`](/community-contracts/api/account#AccountERC7579Hooked) only supports a single hook. A common workaround is to install a [single hook with a multiplexer pattern](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/core-modules/blob/7afffccb44d73dbaca2481e7b92bce0621ea6449/src/HookMultiPlexer/HookMultiPlexer.sol) to extend the functionality to multiple hooks.
</Callout>

### Modules

Functionality is added to accounts through encapsulated functionality deployed as smart contracts called _modules_. The standard defines four primary module types:

* **Validator modules (type 1)**: Handle signature verification and user operation validation
* **Executor modules (type 2)**: Execute operations on behalf of the account
* **Fallback modules (type 3)**: Handle fallback calls for specific function selectors
* **Hook modules (type 4)**: Execute logic before and after operations

Modules can implement multiple types simultaneously, which means you could combine an executor module with hooks to enforce behaviors on an account, such as maintaining ERC-20 approvals or preventing the removal of certain permissions.

See [popular module implementations](https://erc7579.com/modules).

#### Building Custom Modules

The library provides _standard composable modules_ as building blocks with an internal API for developers. By combining these components, you can create a rich set of variants without including unnecessary features.

A good starting point is the [`ERC7579Executor`](/community-contracts/api/account#ERC7579Executor) or [`ERC7579Validator`](/community-contracts/api/account#ERC7579Validator), which include an opinionated base layer easily combined with other abstract modules. Hooks and fallback handlers are more straightforward to implement directly from interfaces:

<include cwd lang='solidity'>./examples/account/modules/MyERC7579Modules.sol</include>

<Callout>
Explore these abstract ERC-7579 modules in the [API Reference](/community-contracts/api/account#modules).

#### Execution Modes

ERC-7579 supports various execution modes, which are encoded as a `bytes32` value. The [`ERC7579Utils`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/account/utils/draft-ERC7579Utils.sol) library provides utility functions to work with these modes:

```solidity
// Parts of an execution mode
type Mode is bytes32;
type CallType is bytes1;
type ExecType is bytes1;
type ModeSelector is bytes4;
type ModePayload is bytes22;
```

##### Call Types

Call types determine the kind of execution:

| Type | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CALLTYPE_SINGLE` | `0x00` | A single `call` execution |
| `CALLTYPE_BATCH` | `0x01` | A batch of `call` executions |
| `CALLTYPE_DELEGATECALL` | `0xFF` | A `delegatecall` execution |

##### Execution Types

Execution types determine how failures are handled:

| Type | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EXECTYPE_DEFAULT` | `0x00` | Reverts on failure |
| `EXECTYPE_TRY` | `0x01` | Does not revert on failure, emits an event instead |

#### Execution Data Format

The execution data format varies depending on the call type:

* For single calls: `abi.encodePacked(target, value, callData)`
* For batched calls: `abi.encode(Execution[])` where `Execution` is a struct containing `target`, `value`, and `callData`
* For delegate calls: `abi.encodePacked(target, callData)`

## Examples

### Social Recovery

Social recovery allows an account to be recovered when access is lost by relying on trusted parties ("guardians") who verify the user’s identity and help restore access.

Social recovery is not a single solution but a design space with multiple configuration options:

* Delay configuration
* Expiration settings
* Different guardian types
* Cancellation windows
* Confirmation requirements

To support _different guardian types_, we can leverage ERC-7913 as discussed in the [multisig](multisig#beyond_standard_signature_verification) section. For ERC-7579 modules, this is implemented through the [`ERC7579Multisig`](/community-contracts/api/account#ERC7579Multisig) validator.

Combined with an [`ERC7579Executor`](/community-contracts/api/account#ERC7579Executor), it provides a basic foundation that can be extended with more sophisticated features:

<include cwd lang='solidity'>./examples/account/modules/MyERC7579SocialRecovery.sol</include>

For enhanced security, you can extend this foundation with scheduling, delays, and cancellations using [`ERC7579DelayedExecutor`](/community-contracts/api/account#ERC7579DelayedExecutor). This allows guardians to schedule recovery operations with a time delay, providing a security window to detect and cancel suspicious recovery attempts before they execute:

<include cwd lang='solidity'>./examples/account/modules/MyERC7579DelayedSocialRecovery.sol</include>

<Callout>
The delayed executor’s signature validation doesn’t require a nonce since operations are uniquely identified by their [operation id](/community-contracts/api/account#ERC7579DelayedExecutor-hashOperation-address-bytes32-bytes32-bytes-) and cannot be scheduled twice.
</Callout>

These implementations demonstrate how to build progressively more secure social recovery mechanisms, from basic multi-signature recovery to time-delayed recovery with cancellation capabilities.

For additional functionality, developers can use:

* [`ERC7579MultisigWeighted`](/community-contracts/api/account#ERC7579MultisigWeighted) to assign different weights to signers
* [`ERC7579MultisigConfirmation`](/community-contracts/api/account#ERC7579MultisigConfirmation) to implement a confirmation system that verifies signatures when adding signers
* [`ERC7579MultisigStorage`](/community-contracts/api/account#ERC7579MultisigStorage) to allow guardians to presign recovery operations for more flexible coordination
