title: Contracts for Cairo
description: Contracts for Cairo
---

**A library for secure smart contract development** written in Cairo for [Starknet](https://starkware.co/product/starknet/). This library consists of a set of [reusable components](components.mdx) to build custom smart contracts, as well as
ready-to-deploy [presets](presets.mdx). You can also find other [utilities](/api/utilities.mdx) including [interfaces and dispatchers](interfaces.mdx) and [test utilities](/api/testing.mdx)
that facilitate testing with Starknet Foundry.

<Callout type='warn'>
This repo contains highly experimental code. Expect rapid iteration. **Use at your own risk.**

## Installation

The library is available as a [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb) package. Follow [this guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html) for installing Cairo and Scarb on your machine
before proceeding, and run the following command to check that the installation was successful:

```bash
$ scarb --version

scarb 2.12.0 (639d0a65e 2025-08-04)
cairo: 2.12.0 (https://crates.io/crates/cairo-lang-compiler/2.12.0)
sierra: 1.7.0
```

### Set up your project

Create an empty directory, and `cd` into it:

```bash
mkdir my_project/ && cd my_project/
```

Initialize a new Scarb project:

```bash
scarb init
```

The contents of `my_project/` should now look like this:

```bash
$ ls

Scarb.toml src
```

### Install the library

<Callout type='warn'>


The `openzeppelin` package is an umbrella package that includes all the packages in the library.
Before version `3.x.x`, the `openzeppelin` and its sub-packages
were versioned together meaning that the version of the `openzeppelin`
package was the same as the version of the sub-packages.

Starting from version `3.x.x`, with the introduction of the `openzeppelin_interfaces` package,
the `openzeppelin` package is versioned independently from the sub-packages.

See the [Versioning of the sub-packages](index.mdx#versioning_of_the_sub_packages) section for more information.

</Callout>

Install the library by declaring it as a dependency in the project’s `Scarb.toml` file:

```javascript
[dependencies]
openzeppelin = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
```

The previous example would import the entire library. We can also add each package as a separate dependency to
improve the building time by not including modules that won’t be used:

```javascript
[dependencies]
openzeppelin_access = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_token = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_interfaces = "1.0.0"
```

## Versioning of the sub-packages

Here you can find a reference of the versioning of the sub-packages for this umbrella version:

```javascript
[dependencies]
openzeppelin_access = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_token = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_access = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_account = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_finance = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_interfaces = "1.0.0"
openzeppelin_governance = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_introspection = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_merkle_tree = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_presets = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_security = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_token = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_upgrades = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
openzeppelin_utils = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
```

## Basic usage

This is how it looks to build an ERC20 contract using the [ERC20 component](erc20.mdx).
Copy the code into `src/lib.cairo`.

```rust
#[starknet::contract]
mod MyERC20Token 
    // NOTE: If you added the entire library as a dependency,
    // use `openzeppelin::token` instead.
    use openzeppelin_token::erc20::{ERC20Component, ERC20HooksEmptyImpl, DefaultConfig;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    component!(path: ERC20Component, storage: erc20, event: ERC20Event);

    // ERC20 Mixin
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ERC20MixinImpl = ERC20Component::ERC20MixinImpl<ContractState>;
    impl ERC20InternalImpl = ERC20Component::InternalImpl<ContractState>;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage 
        #[substorage(v0)]
        erc20: ERC20Component::Storage
    

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event 
        #[flat]
        ERC20Event: ERC20Component::Event
    

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        name: ByteArray,
        symbol: ByteArray,
        fixed_supply: u256,
        recipient: ContractAddress
    ) 
        self.erc20.initializer(name, symbol);
        self.erc20.mint(recipient, fixed_supply);
    
}
```

You can now compile it:

```bash
scarb build
```
