This crate provides a collection of macros that streamline and simplify development with the library.
To use them, you need to add the `openzeppelin_macros` crate as a dependency in your `Scarb.toml` file:

```toml
openzeppelin_macros = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
```

## Attribute macros

* [with_components](macros/with_components.mdx)
* [type_hash](macros/type_hash.mdx)
