# [v0.14.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/releases/tag/v0.14.0) - 2024-06-15

## Summary

### Changed (Breaking)

- Migrate to the `2023_11` edition ([#995](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/995)):
  - Component implementations annotated with `#[embeddable_as()]` (e.g: `AccessControlComponent::AccessControl`) are not public anymore. Note that the embeddable versions are still public (e.g: `AccessControlComponent::AccessControlImpl`).
  - Implementations that can be compiler-derived from traits are not public anymore (e.g: `DualCaseAccessControlImpl` is not public while `DualCaseAccessControlTrait` is).
  - `Secp256k1PointPartialEq` and `DebugSecp256k1Point` are not public anymore.
  - `account::utils::execute_single_call` is not public anymore.
  - Presets are not public anymore, since they should be copied into projects, and not directly imported.
  - `Trace` and `Checkpoint` structs are not public anymore, since they are intended to be used in `ERC20Votes`, and not as generic utilities.
  - `StorageArray` is not public anymore, since this implementation is specific to `ERC20Votes`, and is not intended as a generic utility, but as a temporary solution until Starknet native implementation arrives.

- Apply underscore pattern to modules ([#993](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/993))
  - AccessControlComponent
    - `_set_role_admin` function renamed to `set_role_admin`

    - `_unpause` function renamed to `unpause`

    - `_mint` function renamed to `mint`
    - `_burn` function renamed to `burn`
    - `_update` function renamed to `update`
  - ERC721Component:
    - `_safe_transfer` function renamed to `safe_transfer`
    - `_safe_mint` function renamed to `safe_mint`
    - `_mint` function renamed to `mint`
    - `_transfer` function renamed to `transfer`
    - `_burn` function renamed to `burn`
    - `_update` function renamed to `update`
  - ERC1155Component:
    - `set_base_uri` function renamed to `_set_base_uri`

- Bump Scarb to v2.6.5 ([#1014](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/1014))

# [v0.7.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/releases/tag/v0.7.0) - 2024-02-09

This is the very first release of the OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo 1+, and the result of ~10 months of very hard work.


It’s been a long way, and now the end of the transition feels near. A new stage of maturity is ahead 🌺🚀.

## Usage

Install the library as a [scarb dependency](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/guides/dependencies.html#adding-a-dependency):

```toml
[dependencies]
openzeppelin = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts.git", tag = "v0.7.0" }
```
It requires scarb 0.7.0 and supports Cairo 2.2.0.

## What has changed?

Most things! This is a brand new library written in a new language with a new type system. It exposes a new API and usage model (no more [extensibility pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts-cairo/0.6.1/extensibility#the_pattern)), which will be continually improved.

The feature set is pretty much the same as previous versions with few notable differences:
- `ERC1155` and `UniversalDeployer` ([UDC](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts-cairo/0.6.1/udc)) are still in development
- no `EthAccount` library ([yet](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/573))
- almost no presets like `ERC20Upgradeable`, `ERC721Mintable`, etc. ([yet](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/683))
- upgrades are now based on the `replace_class` syscall
    - no `Proxy` module either ([can’t be implemented in Cairo 1+](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/636#issuecomment-1649788804))

This library also:

- uses [SRC5](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-5.md) instead of [ERC165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) for contract introspection
- follows the [great interface migration plan](https://community.starknet.io/t/the-great-interface-migration/92107) implementing dual interfaces (snake and camel case ones), while also providing dual-case dispatchers to interface with contracts implementing either standard
- is distributed as a [scarb package](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/guides/dependencies.html#adding-a-dependency)

## What’s in it?

This release candidate includes a [revamped docsite](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts-cairo/0.7.0/) along with the following modules:

- Account
- Upgrades
- Introspection module (SRC5)
- Dual interface ABI dispatchers
- Tokens
    - ERC20
    - ERC721
- Access
    - AccessControl
    - Ownable
- Security
    - Pausable
    - Initializable
    - Reentrancy guard


## Acknowledgements
_by [@martriay](https://github.com/martriay)_

The main heroes of this story are [@ericnordelo](https://github.com/ericnordelo) and [@andrew-fleming](https://github.com/andrew-fleming). Over 10 months of relentless work, design, discussions, reviews back and forth, hitting the wall many times with the tooling, language, bugs, missing features. None of that stopped them. And here's the result, for the entire ecosystem to build and enjoy. Thank you.

Also thank you very much to our community of contributors, with special mention for recent contributions to [@milancermak](https://github.com/milancermak) who contributed not only code but also ideas, [@Amxx](https://github.com/Amxx), [@frangio](https://github.com/frangio), [@maciektr](https://github.com/maciektr) and the scarb team, and [@Bal7hazar](https://github.com/Bal7hazar). This is thanks to you too.
