This macro generates a SNIP-12-compatible type hash for a given struct or enum.

<Callout>
This macro is fully compatible with the {SNIP-12} standard revision 1.
</Callout>

## Usage

```rust
#[type_hash(name: "My Struct", debug: true)]
struct MyStruct {
    #[snip12(name: "My Field")]
    my_field: felt252,
}
```

This will generate a type hash for the struct.

```rust
pub const MY_STRUCT_TYPE_HASH: felt252 = 0x1735aa9819941b96c651b740b792a96c854565eaff089b7e293d996828b88a8;
```

And because of the `debug` argument, it will generate the following code:

```rust
pub fn __MY_STRUCT_encoded_type() {
    println!("\"My Struct\"(\"My Field\":\"felt\")");
}
```

## Basic types

The list of supported basic types as defined in the {SNIP-12} standard is:

* felt252
* shortstring
* ClassHash
* ContractAddress
* timestamp
* selector
* merkletree
* u128
* i128

### Examples

Struct with basic types and custom names and kinds:

```rust
#[type_hash(name: "My Struct", debug: true)]
pub struct MyStruct {
    #[snip12(name: "Simple Felt")] // Optional custom name
    pub simple_felt: felt252,
    #[snip12(name: "Class Hash")]
    pub class_hash: ClassHash,
    #[snip12(name: "Target Token")]
    pub target: ContractAddress,
    #[snip12(name: "Timestamp", kind: "timestamp")]
    pub timestamp: u128,
    #[snip12(name: "Selector", kind: "selector")]
    pub selector: felt252,
}

pub const MY_STRUCT_TYPE_HASH: felt252
    = 0x522e0c3dc5e13b0978f4645760a436b1e119fd335842523fee8fbae6057b8c;

```

Enum with basic types and custom names and kinds:

```rust
#[type_hash(name: "My Enum", debug: true)]
pub enum MyEnum {
    #[snip12(name: "Simple Felt")]
    SimpleFelt: felt252,
    #[snip12(name: "Class Hash")]
    ClassHash: ClassHash,
    #[snip12(name: "Target Token")]
    ContractAddress: ContractAddress,
    #[snip12(name: "Timestamp", kind: "timestamp")]
    Timestamp: u128,
    #[snip12(name: "Selector", kind: "selector")]
    Selector: felt252,
}

pub const MY_ENUM_TYPE_HASH: felt252
    = 0x3f30aaa6cda9f699d4131940b10602b78b986feb88f28a19f3b48567cb4b566;
```

## Collection types

The list of supported collection types as defined in the {SNIP-12} standard is:

* Array
* Tuple ***(Only supported for enums)***
* Span ***(Treated as an array)***

<Callout>
While Span is not directly supported by the {SNIP-12} standard, it is treated as an array for the purposes of this macro, since
</Callout>
it is sometimes helpful to use `Span<felt252>` instead of `Array<felt252>` in order to save on gas.

### Examples

Struct with collection types:

```rust
#[type_hash(name: "My Struct", debug: true)]
pub struct MyStruct {
    #[snip12(name: "Member 1")]
    pub member1: Array<felt252>,
    #[snip12(name: "Member 2")]
    pub member2: Span<u128>,
    #[snip12(name: "Timestamps", kind: "Array<timestamp>")]
    pub timestamps: Array<u128>,
}

pub const MY_STRUCT_TYPE_HASH: felt252
    = 0x369cdec45d8c55e70986aed44da0e330375171ba6e25b58e741c0ce02fa8ac;
```

Enum with collection types:

```rust
#[type_hash(name: "My Enum", debug: true)]
pub enum MyEnum {
    #[snip12(name: "Member 1")]
    Member1: Array<felt252>,
    #[snip12(name: "Member 2")]
    Member2: Span<u128>,
    #[snip12(name: "Timestamps", kind: "Array<timestamp>")]
    Timestamps: Array<u128>,
    #[snip12(name: "Name and Last Name", kind: "(shortstring, shortstring)")]
    NameAndLastName: (felt252, felt252),
}

pub const MY_ENUM_TYPE_HASH: felt252
    = 0x9e3e1ebad4448a8344b3318f9cfda5df237588fd8328e1c2968635f09c735d;
```

## Preset types

The list of supported preset types as defined in the {SNIP-12} standard is:

* TokenAmount
* NftId
* u256

### Examples

Struct with preset types:

```rust
#[type_hash(name: "My Struct", debug: true)]
pub struct MyStruct {
    #[snip12(name: "Token Amount")]
    pub token_amount: TokenAmount,
    #[snip12(name: "NFT ID")]
    pub nft_id: NftId,
    #[snip12(name: "Number")]
    pub number: u256,
}

pub const MY_STRUCT_TYPE_HASH: felt252
    = 0x19f63528d68c4f44b7d9003a5a6b7793f5bb6ffc8a22bdec82b413ddf4f9412;
```

Enum with preset types:

```rust
#[type_hash(name: "My Enum", debug: true)]
pub enum MyEnum {
    #[snip12(name: "Token Amount")]
    TokenAmount: TokenAmount,
    #[snip12(name: "NFT ID")]
    NftId: NftId,
    #[snip12(name: "Number")]
    Number: u256,
}

pub const MY_ENUM_TYPE_HASH: felt252
    = 0x39dd19c7e5c5f89e084b78a26200b712c6ae3265f2bae774471c588858421b7;
```

## User-defined types

User-defined types are currently ***NOT SUPPORTED*** since the macro doesnâ€™t have access to scope outside of the
target struct/enum. In the future it may be supported by extending the syntax to explicitly declare the custom type
definition.
