### Ledger [!toc]

#### _owner [toc] [#_owner]
#### [!toc] [#_owner]
<APIItemCompact
  circuitSig='_owner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>'
  kind="ledger"
  id="_owner"
>
  Either a `ZswapCoinPublicKey` or `ContractAddress` representing the owner.
</APIItemCompact>

### Witnesses [!toc]

None.

### Circuits [!toc]

#### initialize [toc] [#initialize]
#### [!toc] [#initialize]
<APIItemCompact
  circuitSig='initialize(initialOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []'
  kind="circuit"
  complexity="k=10, rows=258"
>
  Initializes the contract by setting the `initialOwner`.
  This must be called in the contract’s constructor.

  Requirements:

  * Contract is not already initialized.
  * `initialOwner` is not a ContractAddress.
  * `initialOwner` is not the zero address.
</APIItemCompact>

#### owner [toc] [#owner]
#### [!toc] [#owner]
<APIItemCompact
  circuitSig='owner() → Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>'
  kind="circuit"
  complexity="k=10, rows=84"
>
  Returns the current contract owner.

  Requirements:

  * Contract is initialized.
</APIItemCompact>

#### transferOwnership [toc] [#transferOwnership]
#### [!toc] [#transferOwnership]
<APIItemCompact
  circuitSig='transferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []'
  kind="circuit"
  complexity="k=10, rows=338"
>
  Transfers ownership of the contract to `newOwner`.

  <Callout type='info'>
    Ownership transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
    This restriction prevents permanently disabling access to a circuit.
  </Callout>

  Requirements:

  * Contract is initialized.
  * The caller is the current contract owner.
  * `newOwner` is not a ContractAddress.
  * `newOwner` is not the zero address.
</APIItemCompact>

#### _unsafeTransferOwnership [toc] [#_unsafeTransferOwnership]
#### [!toc] [#_unsafeTransferOwnership]
<APIItemCompact
  circuitSig='_unsafeTransferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []'
  kind="circuit"
  complexity="k=10, rows=335"
>
  Unsafe variant of [`transferOwnership`](#transferOwnership).

  <Callout type='warn'>
    Ownership transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported.
    Ownership privileges sent to a contract address may become uncallable.
    Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.
  </Callout>

  Requirements:

  * Contract is initialized.
  * The caller is the current contract owner.
  * `newOwner` is not the zero address.
</APIItemCompact>

#### renounceOwnership [toc] [#renounceOwnership]
#### [!toc] [#renounceOwnership]
<APIItemCompact
  circuitSig='renounceOwnership() → []'
  kind="circuit"
  complexity="k=10, rows=124"
>
  Leaves the contract without an owner.
  It will not be possible to call [`assertOnlyOwner`](#assertOnlyOwner) circuits anymore.
  Can only be called by the current owner.

  Requirements:

  * Contract is initialized.
  * The caller is the current contract owner.
</APIItemCompact>

#### assertOnlyOwner [toc] [#assertOnlyOwner]
#### [!toc] [#assertOnlyOwner]
<APIItemCompact
  circuitSig='assertOnlyOwner() → []'
  kind="circuit"
  complexity="k=10, rows=115"
>
  Throws if called by any account other than the owner.
  Use this to restrict access of specific circuits to the owner.

  Requirements:

  * Contract is initialized.
  * The caller is the current contract owner.
</APIItemCompact>

#### _transferOwnership [toc] [#_transferOwnership]
#### [!toc] [#_transferOwnership]
<APIItemCompact
  circuitSig='_transferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []'
  kind="circuit"
  complexity="k=10, rows=219"
>
  Transfers ownership of the contract to a `newOwner` without enforcing permission checks on the caller.

  <Callout type='info'>
    Ownership transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
    This restriction prevents permanently disabling access to a circuit.
  </Callout>

  Requirements:

  * Contract is initialized.
  * `newOwner` is not a ContractAddress.
</APIItemCompact>

#### _unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership [toc] [#_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership]
#### [!toc] [#_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership]
<APIItemCompact
  circuitSig='_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []'
  kind="circuit"
  complexity="k=10, rows=216"
>
  Unsafe variant of [`_transferOwnership`](#_transferOwnership).

  <Callout type='warn'>
    Ownership transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported.
    Ownership privileges sent to a contract address may become uncallable.
    Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.
  </Callout>

  Requirements:

  * Contract is initialized.
