## Core

### Ownable

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/compact-contracts/blob/main/contracts/src/access/Ownable.compact)

```ts
import "./node-modules/@openzeppelin-compact/contracts/src/access/Ownable";
```

**Circuits**

* [`initialize(initialOwner)`](#initialize)
* [`owner()`](#owner)
* [`transferOwnership(newOwner)`](#transferownership)
* [`_unsafeTransferOwnership(newOwner)`](#_unsafetransferownership)
* [`renounceOwnership()`](#renounceownership)
* [`assertOnlyOwner()`](#assertonlyowner)
* [`_transferOwnership(newOwner)`](#_transferownership)
* [`_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership(newOwner)`](#_unsafeuncheckedtransferownership)

#### initialize

```ts
initialize(initialOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []
```

Initializes the contract by setting the `initialOwner`.
This must be called in the contract’s constructor.

Requirements:

* Contract is not already initialized.
* `initialOwner` is not a ContractAddress.
* `initialOwner` is not the zero address.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=258

#### owner

```ts
owner() → Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>
```

Returns the current contract owner.

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=84

#### transferOwnership

```ts
transferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []
```

Transfers ownership of the contract to `newOwner`.

<Callout type='info'>
Ownership transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
This restriction prevents permanently disabling access to a circuit.
</Callout>

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.
* The caller is the current contract owner.
* `newOwner` is not a ContractAddress.
* `newOwner` is not the zero address.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=338

#### _unsafeTransferOwnership

```ts
_unsafeTransferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []
```

Unsafe variant of [`transferOwnership`](#transferownership).

<Callout type='warn'>
Ownership transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported.
Ownership privileges sent to a contract address may become uncallable.
Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.
</Callout>

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.
* The caller is the current contract owner.
* `newOwner` is not the zero address.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=335

#### renounceOwnership

```ts
renounceOwnership() → []
```

Leaves the contract without an owner.
It will not be possible to call [`assertOnlyOwner`](#assertonlyowner) circuits anymore.
Can only be called by the current owner.

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.
* The caller is the current contract owner.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=124

#### assertOnlyOwner

```ts
assertOnlyOwner() → []
```

Throws if called by any account other than the owner.
Use this to restrict access of specific circuits to the owner.

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.
* The caller is the current contract owner.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=115

#### _transferOwnership

```ts
_transferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []
```

Transfers ownership of the contract to a `newOwner` without enforcing permission checks on the caller.

<Callout type='info'>
Ownership transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
This restriction prevents permanently disabling access to a circuit.
</Callout>

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.
* `newOwner` is not a ContractAddress.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=219

#### _unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership

```ts
_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []
```

Unsafe variant of [`_transferOwnership`](#_transferownership).

<Callout type='warn'>
Ownership transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported.
Ownership privileges sent to a contract address may become uncallable.
Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.
</Callout>

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=216
