**Circuits**

* [`initialize(initialOwner)`](#initialize)
* [`owner()`](#owner)
* [`transferOwnership(newOwner)`](#transferownership)
* [`_unsafeTransferOwnership(newOwner)`](#_unsafetransferownership)
* [`renounceOwnership()`](#renounceownership)
* [`assertOnlyOwner()`](#assertonlyowner)
* [`_transferOwnership(newOwner)`](#_transferownership)
* [`_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership(newOwner)`](#_unsafeuncheckedtransferownership)

#### `initialize`

**Signature:** `initialize(initialOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []`

**Type:** Circuit

Initializes the contract by setting the `initialOwner`.
This must be called in the contract’s constructor.

Requirements:

* Contract is not already initialized.
* `initialOwner` is not a ContractAddress.
* `initialOwner` is not the zero address.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=258

#### `owner`

**Signature:** `owner() → Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>`

**Type:** Circuit

Returns the current contract owner.

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=84

#### `transferOwnership`

**Signature:** `transferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []`

**Type:** Circuit

Transfers ownership of the contract to `newOwner`.

<Callout>
Ownership transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
</Callout>
This restriction prevents permanently disabling access to a circuit.

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.
* The caller is the current contract owner.
* `newOwner` is not a ContractAddress.
* `newOwner` is not the zero address.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=338

#### `_unsafeTransferOwnership`

**Signature:** `_unsafeTransferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []`

**Type:** Circuit

Unsafe variant of [`transferOwnership`](#transferownership).

<Callout type='warn'>
Ownership transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported.
</Callout>
Ownership privileges sent to a contract address may become uncallable.
Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.
* The caller is the current contract owner.
* `newOwner` is not the zero address.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=335

#### `renounceOwnership`

**Signature:** `renounceOwnership() → []`

**Type:** Circuit

Leaves the contract without an owner.
It will not be possible to call [`assertOnlyOwner`](#assertonlyowner) circuits anymore.
Can only be called by the current owner.

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.
* The caller is the current contract owner.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=124

#### `assertOnlyOwner`

**Signature:** `assertOnlyOwner() → []`

**Type:** Circuit

Throws if called by any account other than the owner.
Use this to restrict access of specific circuits to the owner.

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.
* The caller is the current contract owner.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=115

#### `_transferOwnership`

**Signature:** `_transferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []`

**Type:** Circuit

Transfers ownership of the contract to a `newOwner` without enforcing permission checks on the caller.

<Callout>
Ownership transfers to contract addresses are currently disallowed until contract-to-contract interactions are supported in Compact.
</Callout>
This restriction prevents permanently disabling access to a circuit.

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.
* `newOwner` is not a ContractAddress.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=219

#### `_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership`

**Signature:** `_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []`

**Type:** Circuit

Unsafe variant of [`_transferOwnership`](#_transferownership).

<Callout type='warn'>
Ownership transfers to contract addresses are considered unsafe because contract-to-contract calls are not currently supported.
</Callout>
Ownership privileges sent to a contract address may become uncallable.
Once contract-to-contract calls are supported, this circuit may be deprecated.

Requirements:

* Contract is initialized.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=216
