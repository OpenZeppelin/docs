## Initializable

### Initializable

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/compact-contracts/blob/main/contracts/src/security/Initializable.compact)

```ts
import "./node-modules/@openzeppelin-compact/contracts/src/security/Initializable";
```

**Circuits:**

- [`initialize()`](#initialize)
- [`assertInitialized()`](#assertinitialized)
- [`assertNotInitialized()`](#assertnotinitialized)

#### initialize

```ts
initialize() → []
```

Initializes the state thus ensuring the calling circuit can only be called once.

Requirements:

* Contract must not be initialized.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=38

#### assertInitialized

```ts
assertInitialized() → []
```

Asserts that the contract has been initialized, throwing an error if not.

Requirements:

* Contract must be initialized.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=31

#### assertNotInitialized

```ts
assertNotInitialized() → []
```

Asserts that the contract has not been initialized, throwing an error if it has.

Requirements:

* Contract must not be initialized.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=35

## Pausable

### Pausable

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/compact-contracts/blob/main/contracts/src/security/Pausable.compact)

```ts
import "./node-modules/@openzeppelin-compact/contracts/src/security/Pausable";
```

**Circuits:**

- [`isPaused()`](#ispaused)
- [`assertPaused()`](#assertpaused)
- [`assertNotPaused()`](#assertnotpaused)
- [`_pause()`](#_pause)
- [`_unpause()`](#_unpause)

#### isPaused

```ts
isPaused() → Boolean
```

Returns true if the contract is paused, and false otherwise.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=32

#### assertPaused

```ts
assertPaused() → []
```

Makes a circuit only callable when the contract is paused.

Requirements:

* Contract must be paused.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=31

#### assertNotPaused

```ts
assertNotPaused() → []
```

Makes a circuit only callable when the contract is not paused.

Requirements:

* Contract must not be paused.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=35

#### _pause

```ts
_pause() → []
```

Triggers a stopped state.

Requirements:

* Contract must not be paused.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=38

#### _unpause

```ts
_unpause() → []
```

Lifts the pause on the contract.

Requirements:

* Contract must be paused.

Constraints:

* k=10, rows=34
