title: Ownable
---

An unshielded Ownable library.
This modules provides a basic access control mechanism, where there is an owner
that can be granted exclusive access to specific circuits.
This approach is perfectly reasonable for contracts that have a single administrative user.

The initial owner must be set by using the [initialize](/contracts-compact/api/ownable#Ownable-initialize) circuit during construction.
This can later be changed with [transferOwnership](/contracts-compact/api/ownable#Ownable-transferOwnership).

## Ownership transfers

Ownership can only be transferred to `ZswapCoinPublicKeys` through the main transfer circuits ([transferOwnership](/contracts-compact/api/ownable#Ownable-transferOwnership) and [_transferOwnership](/contracts-compact/api/ownable#Ownable-_transferOwnership)).
In other words, ownership transfers to contract addresses are disallowed through these circuits.
This is because Compact currently does not support contract-to-contract calls which means if a contract is granted ownership, the owner contract cannot directly call the protected circuit.

### Experimental features

This module offers experimental circuits that allow ownership to be granted to contract addresses ([_unsafeTransferOwnership](/contracts-compact/api/ownable#Ownable-_unsafeTransferOwnership) and [_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership](/contracts-compact/api/ownable#Ownable-_unsafeUncheckedTransferOwnership)).
Note that the circuit names are very explicit ("unsafe") with these experimental circuits.
Until contract-to-contract calls are supported,
there is no direct way for a contract to call circuits of other contracts or transfer ownership back to a user.

<Callout>
The unsafe circuits are planned to become deprecated once contract-to-contract calls become available.
</Callout>

## Usage

Import the Ownable module into the implementing contract.
It’s recommended to prefix the module with `Ownable_` to avoid circuit signature clashes.

```ts
pragma language_version >= 0.16.0;

import CompactStandardLibrary;
import "./node_modules/@openzeppelin-compact/ownable/src/Ownable" prefix Ownable_;

constructor(
  initialOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>
)
  Ownable_initialize(initialOwner);
```

To protect a circuit so that only the contract owner may call it,
insert the `assertOnlyOwner` circuit in the beginning of the circuit body like this:

```ts
export circuit mySensitiveCircuit(): []
  Ownable_assertOnlyOwner();

  // Do something
  ```

  Contracts may expose [transferOwnership](/contracts-compact/api/ownable#Ownable-transferOwnership) to allow the owner to transfer ownership.

  ```ts
export circuit transferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>): []
  Ownable_transferOwnership(newOwner);
```

Here’s a complete contract showcasing how to integrate the Ownable module and protect sensitive circuits.

```ts
pragma language_version >= 0.16.0;

import CompactStandardLibrary;
import "./node_modules/@openzeppelin-compact/ownable/src/Ownable" prefix Ownable_;

/**
 * Set `initialOwner` as the owner of the contract.
 */
constructor(initialOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>)
  Ownable_initialize(initialOwner);

/**
 * The current owner of the contact.
 */
export circuit owner(): Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>
  return Ownable_owner();

/**
 * Transfers ownership of the contract.
 * Can only be called by the current owner.
 */
export circuit transferOwnership(newOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>): []
  Ownable_transferOwnership(newOwner);

/**
 * Leaves the contract without an owner.
 * Can only be called by the current owner.
 * Renouncing ownership means `mySensitiveCircuit` can never be called again.
 */
export circuit renounceOwnership(): []
  Ownable_renounceOwnership();

/**
 * This is the protected circuit that only the current owner can call.
 */
export circuit mySensitiveCircuit(): []
  // Protects the circuit
  Ownable_assertOnlyOwner();

  // Do something
```
<Callout>
For more complex logic, contracts may transfer ownership to another user irrespective of the caller by leveraging [_transferOwnership](/contracts-compact/api/ownable#Ownable-_transferOwnership).
This is generally more useful when contract addresses are the owner or when a contract has a unique deployment process.
