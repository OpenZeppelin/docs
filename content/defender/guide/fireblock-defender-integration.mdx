   This will trigger Defender to generate a public/private key-pair. The CSR is then generated and signed with the private key and securely stored to prevent leakage.

## 2. Create Fireblocks API user
1. First, you will need to import the CSR within the Fireblocks UI when creating a new API user. Note that the API user will require any role that can _at least_ initiate transactions, e.g. Signer.
