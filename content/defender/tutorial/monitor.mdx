Defender allows you to monitor smart contract transactions and events across chains. This tutorial shows how to build a customized Monitor template and use it in a real-world context to monitor a [Uniswap V2, window=_blank](https://uniswap.org/) pool.

## Pre-requisites

* OpenZeppelin Defender account.

## 1. Configure the monitor

You will monitor the `0xB4e16d0168e52d35CaCD2c6185b44281Ec28C9Dc` contract in the Ethereum mainnet, which is the [Uniswap V2 USDC-ETH pool, window=_blank](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB4e16d0168e52d35CaCD2c6185b44281Ec28C9Dc). This contract has constant activity, making it a good candidate to see how quick monitors are. To configure a monitor, follow these steps:

1. Open [Defender Monitor, window=_blank](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/monitor) in a web browser.
2. Click on **Create Monitor**.

3. Name this monitor as `Uniswap V2: USDC-ETH Monitor`.
4. Select the `Financial` risk category.
5. Click the **Contracts** field and select to add a new address.
6. Fill the form with the following parameters and select it as contract to monitor:

+
* Name: `Uniswap V2: USDC-ETH Pool`
* Network: `Mainnet`
* Address: `0xB4e16d0168e52d35CaCD2c6185b44281Ec28C9Dc`

1. Select `1 confirmation block`. Defender will automatically pick up the ABI, so we can select the transaction filters next.

1. Add the `status == "success"` parameter to **Transaction Properties** to filter by transaction-level data and confirm transactions are successfully confirmed and not reverted.

1. Select the `Swap` event from the dropdown menu. This event is emitted every time a swap is made in the pool.

+

1. Skip function-level filters as you are already tracking all `Swap` events emitted from the contract. 
2. Select a notification channel of your choice (such as email).
3. Click on **Save Monitor**.

Your monitor is now running!

## 2. Receive alerts

Alerts will start rolling in as long as the monitor is active. Your notifications should look like this if you selected email as the notification channel:

![Monitor Telegram alert](/defender/tutorial-monitor-receive.png)

You can pause or delete monitors on the [Defender Monitor, window=_blank](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/monitor) page. This one will trigger frequently so you will likely want to pause it using the toggle on the right after you receive a couple of alerts. You can also save a monitor as a template by clicking on the dotted icon of its card and `Save as Template`.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You can modify the monitor to filter for specific `Swap` data or target another pool. In case you are interested in advanced use cases, we are working on monitor-related guides.

After setting up a monitor, we recommend creating Actions on Defender. Learn how to use Actions with its tutorial [here](:tutorial/actions.adoc).
