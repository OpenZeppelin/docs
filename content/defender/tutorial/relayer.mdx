title: Using Relayer for Sending Transactions
description: Using Relayer for Sending Transactions
---

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the [Relayers](module/relayers.mdx) to send transactions. We will cover:

* Checking relayer information.
* Sending a transaction.
* Checking the relayer status.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a basic understanding of how to use the Relayer to interact with smart contracts.

## Pre-requisites

* OpenZeppelin Defender account.
* [NodeJS and NPM, window=_blank](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Typescript for Node js, window=_blank](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node)
* Any IDE or text editor

## 1. Set Up Relayer

Let’s start by creating a Relayer:

* Open [Defender Operate & Automate](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/#/relayers) in a web browser.

  ![Manage Relayer](/defender/tutorial-relayer-step1.png)
* Click on **Create Relayer** with the name ETH Sepolia Relayer and Sepolia network.

  ![Create Relayer](/defender/tutorial-relayer-step2.png)
* Fund it with some Sepolia ETH. This relayer will send and pay for the automated transactions.
* To create an API key for a Relayer, click on the Relayer and then on the **More** button to expand the dropdown and select **Create API Key**

  ![Create Relayer API](/defender/tutorial-relayer-step3.png)
* Now you can set API key expiration in minutes, hours or days.

  ![Save Relayer API](/defender/tutorial-relayer-step3-1.png)
* Once the API Key is created, make sure to write down the secret key. The API secret is only visible once during the creation — if you don’t write it down, it’s lost forever.

## 2. Check Relayer Information

* Let’s start by checking the information of our relayer.
* Add Relayer in `.env` File
* Edit `.env` file in your project root directory and add your Relayer API Key and Secret:

  ```jsx
  RELAYER_API_KEY=your_api_key
  RELAYER_SECRET_KEY=your_api_secret
  ```
* Create a file named `storeObject.ts` in the project. 
* Now let’s add the following code:

  ```jsx
  const  Defender  = require('@openzeppelin/defender-sdk');

  const dotenv = require('dotenv');

  dotenv.config();

  async function main() 

  const client = new Defender({

  relayerApiKey: process.env.RELAYER_API_KEY,
  relayerApiSecret: process.env.RELAYER_SECRET_KEY,
  );

  const info = await client.relaySigner.getRelayer();
  console.log('Relayer Info:', JSON.stringify(info, null, 2));

  }

  main().catch((error) => 
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
  );

  ```
* Execute the script to check the relayer information:

  ```jsx
  ts-node storeObject.ts
  ```

      Alternatively, if you want to use Node directly:
```jsx
node storeObject.js
```

## 3. Send Transaction

Next, we will send a transaction using the relayer. 

* Let’s edit the same file and add the following code:

  ```jsx
  const tx = await client.relaySigner.sendTransaction(
      to: '0x1B9ec5Cc45977927fe6707f2A02F51e1415f2052',
      speed: 'fast',
      data: '0x6057361d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a',
      gasLimit: '80000',
    );
  console.log('Transaction sent! Hash:', tx.hash);
  ```

Here we are using the Sepolia [Box contract](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1B9ec5Cc45977927fe6707f2A02F51e1415f2052) as the target, which is:
```jsx
0x1B9ec5Cc45977927fe6707f2A02F51e1415f2052
```

and data is the encoded version of the store() function with ‘10’ as input parameter.
```jsx
0x6057361d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a
```

* Execute the script to send a transaction:

  ```jsx
  ts-node storeObject.ts
  ```

      Alternatively, if you want to use Node directly:
```jsx
node storeObject.js
```

## 4. Check Transaction Status

Finally, let’s check the status of our transaction status.

* Edit the file again and add the following code:

  ```jsx
  const txUpdate = await client.relaySigner.getTransaction(tx.transactionId);
  console.log('Tx Status', JSON.stringify(txUpdate, null, 2));
  ```
* Execute the script to check the relayer status:

  ```jsx
  ts-node storeObject.ts
  ```

      Alternatively, if you want to use Node directly:
```jsx
node storeObject.js
```

## 5. Next Steps
Congratulations! You have successfully used the Relayer to check information, send transactions, and verify the transaction status. By following this tutorial, you have gained a fundamental understanding of how to interact with smart contracts using the Relayer.

* For more information on using Relayer, refer to the [Relayers](/module/relayers.mdx) documentation.
* Explore the [Actions](:tutorial/actions.adoc) to automate your smart contract operational tasks with easy integration with the rest of Defender.
