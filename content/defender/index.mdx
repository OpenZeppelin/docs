New sign-ups were disabled on June 30, 2025. Until the final shutdown on July 1, 2026, Defender will remain fully operational while we focus on the open source versions of tools like Relayers and Monitor. Detailed migration guides are coming soon to help you transition seamlessly to open source.

OpenZeppelin Defender is a mission-critical developer security platform to **code**, **audit**, **deploy**, **monitor**, and **operate** blockchain applications with confidence.

Integrating directly into the developer workflow, Defender makes it easy and fast for developers and operators to prevent and fix security issues pre and post-deployment.

## Subscriptions
Defender offers flexible subscriptions to match your team’s needs and support your project at any scale.

* **Builder (Free)** - Suitable for individuals and small projects that are getting started on testnets and need access to all basic features with limited quotas.
* **Professional** - For mature projects running on mainnets that need access to premium features, higher quotas and metered billing, as well as access to OpenZeppelin support and SLA.
* **Enterprise** - For large projects with higher volumes that need a custom plan to meet their project needs, with higher quotas, access to all premium and security features, and a dedicated support channel.
