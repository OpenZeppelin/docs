title: Polkadot Parachain Runtimes
---

A collection of secure runtime templates to build parachains more easily on Polkadot.

## Runtimes
* [Generic Runtime Template](runtimes/generic)
* [EVM Runtime Template](runtimes/evm)

## Where to get started
* [Quick Start](guides/quick_start): a generic parachain runtime that works out of the box. It has all the must have features, and allows further customization based on your projectâ€™s needs. Generic Runtime Template also serves as the base for our other runtime templates.
* [Testing with Zombienet](guides/testing_with_zombienet): a more opinionated parachain runtime template that maximizes Ethereum compatibility by using `AccountId20` and configures a local EVM instance. You can easily migrate/deploy Solidity Smart Contracts to this one.
