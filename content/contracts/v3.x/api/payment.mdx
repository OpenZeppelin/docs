Utilities related to sending and receiving payments. Examples are PullPayment, which implements the best security practices when sending funds to third parties, and PaymentSplitter to receive incoming payments among a number of beneficiaries.

<Callout>
When transferring funds to and from untrusted third parties, there is always a security risk of reentrancy. If you would like to learn more about this and ways to protect against it, check out our blog post [Reentrancy After Istanbul](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/).

## Utilities

### ``PaymentSplitter``

This contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware
that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.

The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each
account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim
an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned.

`PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the
accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the release
function.

**Functions**

* [`constructor(payees, shares_)`](#PaymentSplitter-constructor-address---uint256-)
* [`receive()`](#PaymentSplitter-receive)
* [`totalShares()`](#PaymentSplitter-totalShares)
* [`totalReleased()`](#PaymentSplitter-totalReleased)
* [`shares(account)`](#PaymentSplitter-shares-address-)
* [`released(account)`](#PaymentSplitter-released-address-)
* [`payee(index)`](#PaymentSplitter-payee-uint256-)
* [`release(account)`](#PaymentSplitter-release-address-payable-)

**Events**

* [`PayeeAdded(account, shares)`](#PaymentSplitter-PayeeAdded-address-uint256-)
* [`PaymentReleased(to, amount)`](#PaymentSplitter-PaymentReleased-address-uint256-)
* [`PaymentReceived(from, amount)`](#PaymentSplitter-PaymentReceived-address-uint256-)

<a id="PaymentSplitter-constructor"></a>

#### `constructor(address[] payees, uint256[] shares_) *public*`

Creates an instance of `PaymentSplitter` where each account in `payees` is assigned the number of shares at
the matching position in the `shares` array.

All addresses in `payees` must be non-zero. Both arrays must have the same non-zero length, and there must be no
duplicates in `payees`.

<a id="PaymentSplitter-receive"></a>

#### `receive() *external*`

The Ether received will be logged with PaymentReceived events. Note that these events are not fully
reliable: it’s possible for a contract to receive Ether without triggering this function. This only affects the
reliability of the events, and not the actual splitting of Ether.

To learn more about this see the Solidity documentation for
https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html#fallback-function[fallback
functions].

<a id="PaymentSplitter-totalShares"></a>

#### `totalShares() → uint256 *public*`

Getter for the total shares held by payees.

<a id="PaymentSplitter-totalReleased"></a>

#### `totalReleased() → uint256 *public*`

Getter for the total amount of Ether already released.

<a id="PaymentSplitter-shares"></a>

#### `shares(address account) → uint256 *public*`

Getter for the amount of shares held by an account.

<a id="PaymentSplitter-released"></a>

#### `released(address account) → uint256 *public*`

Getter for the amount of Ether already released to a payee.

<a id="PaymentSplitter-payee"></a>

#### `payee(uint256 index) → address *public*`

Getter for the address of the payee number `index`.

<a id="PaymentSplitter-release"></a>

#### `release(address payable account) *public*`

Triggers a transfer to `account` of the amount of Ether they are owed, according to their percentage of the
total shares and their previous withdrawals.

<a id="PaymentSplitter-PayeeAdded"></a>

#### `PayeeAdded(address account, uint256 shares) *event*`

<a id="PaymentSplitter-PaymentReleased"></a>

#### `PaymentReleased(address to, uint256 amount) *event*`

<a id="PaymentSplitter-PaymentReceived"></a>

#### `PaymentReceived(address from, uint256 amount) *event*`

### ``PullPayment``

Simple implementation of a
[pull-payment](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls)
strategy, where the paying contract doesn’t interact directly with the
receiver account, which must withdraw its payments itself.

Pull-payments are often considered the best practice when it comes to sending
Ether, security-wise. It prevents recipients from blocking execution, and
eliminates reentrancy concerns.

<Callout>
If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways
</Callout>
to protect against it, check out our blog post
[Reentrancy After Istanbul](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/).

To use, derive from the `PullPayment` contract, and use _asyncTransfer
instead of Solidity’s `transfer` function. Payees can query their due
payments with payments, and retrieve them with withdrawPayments.

**Functions**

* [`constructor()`](#PullPayment-constructor)
* [`withdrawPayments(payee)`](#PullPayment-withdrawPayments-address-payable-)
* [`payments(dest)`](#PullPayment-payments-address-)
* [`_asyncTransfer(dest, amount)`](#PullPayment-_asyncTransfer-address-uint256-)

<a id="PaymentSplitter-constructor"></a>

#### `constructor() *internal*`

<a id="PaymentSplitter-withdrawPayments"></a>

#### `withdrawPayments(address payable payee) *public*`

Withdraw accumulated payments, forwarding all gas to the recipient.

Note that _any_ account can call this function, not just the `payee`.
This means that contracts unaware of the `PullPayment` protocol can still
receive funds this way, by having a separate account call
withdrawPayments.

<Callout type='warn'>
Forwarding all gas opens the door to reentrancy vulnerabilities.
</Callout>
Make sure you trust the recipient, or are either following the
checks-effects-interactions pattern or using ReentrancyGuard.

<a id="PaymentSplitter-payments"></a>

#### `payments(address dest) → uint256 *public*`

Returns the payments owed to an address.

<a id="PaymentSplitter-_asyncTransfer"></a>

#### `_asyncTransfer(address dest, uint256 amount) *internal*`

Called by the payer to store the sent amount as credit to be pulled.
Funds sent in this way are stored in an intermediate Escrow contract, so
there is no danger of them being spent before withdrawal.

## Escrow

### ``Escrow``

Base escrow contract, holds funds designated for a payee until they
withdraw them.

Intended usage: This contract (and derived escrow contracts) should be a
standalone contract, that only interacts with the contract that instantiated
it. That way, it is guaranteed that all Ether will be handled according to
the `Escrow` rules, and there is no need to check for payable functions or
transfers in the inheritance tree. The contract that uses the escrow as its
payment method should be its owner, and provide public methods redirecting
to the escrow’s deposit and withdraw.

**Functions**

* [`depositsOf(payee)`](#Escrow-depositsOf-address-)
* [`deposit(payee)`](#Escrow-deposit-address-)
* [`withdraw(payee)`](#Escrow-withdraw-address-payable-)

**Ownable**

* [`constructor()`](#Ownable-constructor)

* [`transferOwnership(newOwner)`](#Ownable-transferOwnership-address-)

**Events**

* [`Deposited(payee, weiAmount)`](#Escrow-Deposited-address-uint256-)
* [`Withdrawn(payee, weiAmount)`](#Escrow-Withdrawn-address-uint256-)

**Ownable**

<a id="PaymentSplitter-depositsOf"></a>

#### `depositsOf(address payee) → uint256 *public*`

<a id="PaymentSplitter-deposit"></a>

#### `deposit(address payee) *public*`

Stores the sent amount as credit to be withdrawn.

<a id="PaymentSplitter-withdraw"></a>

#### `withdraw(address payable payee) *public*`

Withdraw accumulated balance for a payee, forwarding all gas to the
recipient.

<Callout type='warn'>
Forwarding all gas opens the door to reentrancy vulnerabilities.

Make sure you trust the recipient, or are either following the
checks-effects-interactions pattern or using ReentrancyGuard.

implemented by derived contracts.

<a id="PaymentSplitter-withdraw"></a>

#### `withdraw(address payable payee) *public*`

### ``RefundEscrow``

Escrow that holds funds for a beneficiary, deposited from multiple
parties.
Intended usage: See Escrow. Same usage guidelines apply here.
The owner account (that is, the contract that instantiates this
contract) may deposit, close the deposit period, and allow for either
withdrawal by the beneficiary, or refunds to the depositors. All interactions
with `RefundEscrow` will be made through the owner contract.
