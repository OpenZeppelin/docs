All draft contracts were either moved into a different directory or removed from the OpenZeppelin Contracts library on the [v3.0.0 release](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/openzeppelin-contracts-v3-0-beta-release/2256).

* `ERC20Migrator`: removed.
* [`ERC20Snapshot`](contracts/v3.x/api/token/ERC20.mdx#ERC20Snapshot): moved to `token/ERC20`.
* `ERC20Detailed` and `ERC1046`: removed.
* `TokenVesting`: removed. Pending a replacement that is being discussed in [`#1214`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/1214).
* [`Counters`](contracts/v3.x/api/utils.mdx#Counters): moved to [`utils`](contracts/v3.x/api/utils.mdx).
* [`Strings`](contracts/v3.x/api/utils.mdx#Strings): moved to [`utils`](contracts/v3.x/api/utils.mdx).
* [`SignedSafeMath`](contracts/v3.x/api/utils.mdx#SignedSafeMath): moved to [`utils`](contracts/v3.x/api/utils.mdx).

Removed contracts are still available on the v2.5 release of OpenZeppelin Contracts, which you can install by running:

```console
$ npm install @openzeppelin/contracts@v2.5
```

Refer to the [v2.x documentation](2.x@contracts:api:drafts.mdx) when working with them.
