## List of standardized interfaces
These interfaces are available as `.sol` files, and also as compiler `.json` ABI files (through the npm package). These
are useful to interact with third party contracts that implement them.

from.

<a id="IERC4626-convertToAssets-uint256-"></a>

### `convertToAssets(uint256 shares) ‚Üí uint256 assets`
*external*

Returns the amount of assets that the Vault would exchange for the amount of shares provided, in an ideal

- MUST NOT revert.

NOTE: any unfavorable discrepancy between convertToShares and previewDeposit SHOULD be considered slippage in
share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by depositing.

current on-chain conditions.

  in the same transaction. I.e. mint should return the same or fewer assets as previewMint if called in the
  same transaction.
- MUST NOT account for mint limits like those returned from maxMint and should always act as though the mint
  would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough tokens approved, etc.
- MUST be inclusive of deposit fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of deposit fees.
- MUST NOT revert.

NOTE: any unfavorable discrepancy between convertToAssets and previewMint SHOULD be considered slippage in
share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by minting.

  approving enough underlying tokens to the Vault contract, etc).

NOTE: most implementations will require pre-approval of the Vault with the Vault‚Äôs underlying asset token.

<a id="IERC4626-maxWithdraw-address-"></a>

### `maxWithdraw(address owner) ‚Üí uint256 maxAssets`
*external*

Returns the maximum amount of the underlying asset that can be withdrawn from the owner balance in the
Vault, through a withdraw call.

  call in the same transaction. I.e. withdraw should return the same or fewer shares as previewWithdraw if
  called
  in the same transaction.
- MUST NOT account for withdrawal limits like those returned from maxWithdraw and should always act as though
  the withdrawal would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough shares, etc.
- MUST be inclusive of withdrawal fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of withdrawal fees.
- MUST NOT revert.

NOTE: any unfavorable discrepancy between convertToShares and previewWithdraw SHOULD be considered slippage in
share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by depositing.

<a id="IERC4626-withdraw-uint256-address-address-"></a>

### `withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) ‚Üí uint256 shares`

  not having enough shares, etc).

Note that some implementations will require pre-requesting to the Vault before a withdrawal may be performed.
Those methods should be performed separately.

### `maxRedeem(address owner) ‚Üí uint256 maxShares`
*external*

Returns the maximum amount of Vault shares that can be redeemed from the owner balance in the Vault,
through a redeem call.

- MUST return a limited value if owner is subject to some withdrawal limit or timelock.
- MUST return balanceOf(owner) if owner is not subject to any withdrawal limit or timelock.
- MUST NOT revert.

<a id="IERC4626-previewRedeem-uint256-"></a>

### `previewRedeem(uint256 shares) ‚Üí uint256 assets`
*external*

Allows an on-chain or off-chain user to simulate the effects of their redeemption at the current block,
given current on-chain conditions.

- MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of assets that would be withdrawn in a redeem call
  in the same transaction. I.e. redeem should return the same or more assets as previewRedeem if called in the
  same transaction.
- MUST NOT account for redemption limits like those returned from maxRedeem and should always act as though the
  redemption would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough shares, etc.
- MUST be inclusive of withdrawal fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of withdrawal fees.
- MUST NOT revert.

NOTE: any unfavorable discrepancy between convertToAssets and previewRedeem SHOULD be considered slippage in
share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by redeeming.

<a id="IERC4626-redeem-uint256-address-address-"></a>

### `redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) ‚Üí uint256 assets`
*external*

Burns exactly shares from owner and sends assets of underlying tokens to receiver.

- MUST emit the Withdraw event.
- MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the
  redeem execution, and are accounted for during redeem.
- MUST revert if all of shares cannot be redeemed (due to withdrawal limit being reached, slippage, the owner
  not having enough shares, etc).

NOTE: some implementations will require pre-requesting to the Vault before a withdrawal may be performed.
Those methods should be performed separately.

ERC1822: Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS) documents a method for upgradeability through a simplified
proxy whose upgrades are fully controlled by the current implementation.

### Functions
- [proxiableUUID()](#IERC1822Proxiable-proxiableUUID--)

<a id="IERC1822Proxiable-proxiableUUID--"></a>

### `proxiableUUID() ‚Üí bytes32`
*external*

Returns the storage slot that the proxiable contract assumes is being used to store the implementation
address.

IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks
bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this
function revert if invoked through a proxy.
