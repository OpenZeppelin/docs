These contracts aim to cover common security practices.

* [`PullPayment`](#PullPayment): A pattern that can be used to avoid reentrancy attacks.
* [`ReentrancyGuard`](#ReentrancyGuard): A modifier that can prevent reentrancy during certain functions.
* [`Pausable`](#Pausable): A common emergency response mechanism that can pause functionality while a remediation is pending.

## Contracts

[`PullPayment`](#PullPayment)

[`ReentrancyGuard`](#ReentrancyGuard)

[`Pausable`](#Pausable)

<a id="Pausable"></a>

## `Pausable` [üìÅ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.9.6/contracts/security/Pausable.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/Pausable.sol";
```

Contract module which allows children to implement an emergency stop
mechanism that can be triggered by an authorized account.

This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the
modifiers `whenNotPaused` and `whenPaused`, which can be applied to
the functions of your contract. Note that they will not be pausable by
simply including this module, only once the modifiers are put in place.

### Modifiers
- [whenNotPaused()](#Pausable-whenNotPaused--)
- [whenPaused()](#Pausable-whenPaused--)

### Functions
- [constructor()](#Pausable-constructor--)
- [paused()](#Pausable-paused--)
- [_requireNotPaused()](#Pausable-_requireNotPaused--)
- [_requirePaused()](#Pausable-_requirePaused--)
- [_pause()](#Pausable-_pause--)
- [_unpause()](#Pausable-_unpause--)

### Events
- [Paused(account)](#Pausable-Paused-address-)
- [Unpaused(account)](#Pausable-Unpaused-address-)

<a id="Pausable-whenNotPaused--"></a>

### `whenNotPaused()`

Modifier to make a function callable only when the contract is not paused.

Requirements:

Requirements:

<a id="Pausable-constructor--"></a>

### `constructor()`
*internal*

Initializes the contract in unpaused state.

<a id="Pausable-paused--"></a>

### `paused() ‚Üí bool`
*public*

Returns true if the contract is paused, and false otherwise.

<a id="Pausable-_requireNotPaused--"></a>

### `_requireNotPaused()`
*internal*

Throws if the contract is paused.

<a id="Pausable-_requirePaused--"></a>

### `_requirePaused()`
*internal*

Throws if the contract is not paused.

<a id="Pausable-_pause--"></a>

### `_pause()`
*internal*

Triggers stopped state.

Requirements:

- The contract must not be paused.

<a id="Pausable-_unpause--"></a>

### `_unpause()`
*internal*

Returns to normal state.

Requirements:

- The contract must be paused.

<a id="Pausable-Paused-address-"></a>

### `Paused(address account)`
*event*

Emitted when the pause is triggered by `account`.

<a id="Pausable-Unpaused-address-"></a>

### `Unpaused(address account)`
*event*

Emitted when the pause is lifted by `account`.

<a id="PullPayment"></a>

## `PullPayment` [üìÅ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.9.6/contracts/security/PullPayment.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/PullPayment.sol";
```

Simple implementation of a
[pull-payment](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/general/external-calls/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls)
strategy, where the paying contract doesn't interact directly with the
receiver account, which must withdraw its payments itself.

Pull-payments are often considered the best practice when it comes to sending
Ether, security-wise. It prevents recipients from blocking execution, and
eliminates reentrancy concerns.

TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways
to protect against it, check out our blog post
[Reentrancy After Istanbul](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/).

To use, derive from the `PullPayment` contract, and use [`PullPayment._asyncTransfer`](#PullPayment-_asyncTransfer-address-uint256-)
instead of Solidity's `transfer` function. Payees can query their due
payments with [`PullPayment.payments`](#PullPayment-payments-address-), and retrieve them with [`PullPayment.withdrawPayments`](#PullPayment-withdrawPayments-address-payable-).

### Functions
- [constructor()](#PullPayment-constructor--)
- [withdrawPayments(payee)](#PullPayment-withdrawPayments-address-payable-)
- [payments(dest)](#PullPayment-payments-address-)
- [_asyncTransfer(dest, amount)](#PullPayment-_asyncTransfer-address-uint256-)

<a id="PullPayment-constructor--"></a>

### `constructor()`
*internal*

<a id="PullPayment-withdrawPayments-address-payable-"></a>

### `withdrawPayments(address payable payee)`
*public*

Withdraw accumulated payments, forwarding all gas to the recipient.

Note that _any_ account can call this function, not just the `payee`.
This means that contracts unaware of the `PullPayment` protocol can still
receive funds this way, by having a separate account call
[`PullPayment.withdrawPayments`](#PullPayment-withdrawPayments-address-payable-).

WARNING: Forwarding all gas opens the door to reentrancy vulnerabilities.
Make sure you trust the recipient, or are either following the
checks-effects-interactions pattern or using [`ReentrancyGuard`](#ReentrancyGuard).

<a id="PullPayment-payments-address-"></a>

### `payments(address dest) ‚Üí uint256`
*public*

Returns the payments owed to an address.

<a id="PullPayment-_asyncTransfer-address-uint256-"></a>

### `_asyncTransfer(address dest, uint256 amount)`
*internal*

Called by the payer to store the sent amount as credit to be pulled.
Funds sent in this way are stored in an intermediate [`Escrow`](utils#Escrow) contract, so
there is no danger of them being spent before withdrawal.

<a id="ReentrancyGuard"></a>

## `ReentrancyGuard` [üìÅ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.9.6/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
```

Contract module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.

Inheriting from `ReentrancyGuard` will make the [`ReentrancyGuard.nonReentrant`](#ReentrancyGuard-nonReentrant--) modifier
available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested
(reentrant) calls to them.

Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as
`nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making
those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry
points to them.

to protect against it, check out our blog post
[Reentrancy After Istanbul](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/).

### Modifiers
- [nonReentrant()](#ReentrancyGuard-nonReentrant--)

### Functions
- [constructor()](#ReentrancyGuard-constructor--)
- [_reentrancyGuardEntered()](#ReentrancyGuard-_reentrancyGuardEntered--)

<a id="ReentrancyGuard-nonReentrant--"></a>

### `nonReentrant()`

Prevents a contract from calling itself, directly or indirectly.
Calling a `nonReentrant` function from another `nonReentrant`
function is not supported. It is possible to prevent this from happening
by making the `nonReentrant` function external, and making it call a
`private` function that does the actual work.

<a id="ReentrancyGuard-constructor--"></a>

### `constructor()`
*internal*

<a id="ReentrancyGuard-_reentrancyGuardEntered--"></a>

### `_reentrancyGuardEntered() ‚Üí bool`
*internal*

Returns true if the reentrancy guard is currently set to "entered", which indicates there is a
`nonReentrant` function in the call stack.
