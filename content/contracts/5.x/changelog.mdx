- Bumped minimum compiler version required to 0.8.20 ([#4288](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4288))
- Use of `abi.encodeCall` in place of `abi.encodeWithSelector` and `abi.encodeWithSignature` for improved type-checking of parameters ([#4293](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4293))
- Replaced some uses of `abi.encodePacked` with clearer alternatives (e.g. `bytes.concat`, `string.concat`). ([#4504](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4504)) ([#4296](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4296))
- Overrides are now used internally for a number of functions that were previously hardcoded to their default implementation in certain locations: `ERC1155Supply.totalSupply`, `ERC721.ownerOf`, `ERC721.balanceOf` and `ERC721.totalSupply` in `ERC721Enumerable`, `ERC20.totalSupply` in `ERC20FlashMint`, and `ERC1967._getImplementation` in `ERC1967Proxy`. ([#4299](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4299))
- Removed the `override` specifier from functions that only override a single interface function. ([#4315](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4315))
- Switched to using explicit Solidity import statements. Some previously available symbols may now have to be separately imported. ([#4399](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4399))
- `Governor`, `Initializable`, and `UUPSUpgradeable`: Use internal functions in modifiers to optimize bytecode size. ([#4472](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4472))
- Upgradeable contracts now use namespaced storage (EIP-7201). ([#4534](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4534))
- Upgradeable contracts no longer transpile interfaces and libraries. ([#4628](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4628))

#### Access

- `Ownable`: Added an `initialOwner` parameter to the constructor, making the ownership initialization explicit. ([#4267](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4267))
- `Ownable`: Prevent using address(0) as the initial owner. ([#4531](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4531))

- `access`: Moved `AccessControl` extensions to a dedicated directory. ([#4359](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4359))
- `AccessManager`: Added a new contract for managing access control of complex systems in a consolidated location. ([#4121](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4121))
- `AccessManager`, `AccessManaged`, `GovernorTimelockAccess`: Ensure that calldata shorter than 4 bytes is not padded to 4 bytes. ([#4624](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4624))
- `AccessManager`: Use named return parameters in functions that return multiple values. ([#4624](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4624))
- `AccessManager`: Make `schedule` and `execute` more conservative when delay is 0. ([#4644](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4644))

#### Finance

- `VestingWallet`: Fixed revert during 1 second time window when duration is 0. ([#4502](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4502))
- `VestingWallet`: Use `Ownable` instead of an immutable `beneficiary`. ([#4508](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4508))

#### Governance

- `Governor`: Optimized use of storage for proposal data ([#4268](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4268))
- `Governor`: Added validation in ERC1155 and ERC721 receiver hooks to ensure Governor is the executor. ([#4314](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4314))
- `Governor`: Refactored internals to implement common queuing logic in the core module of the Governor. Added `queue` and `_queueOperations` functions that act at different levels. Modules that implement queuing via timelocks are expected to override `_queueOperations` to implement the timelock-specific logic. Added `_executeOperations` as the equivalent for execution. ([#4360](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4360))
- `Governor`: Added `voter` and `nonce` parameters in signed ballots, to avoid forging signatures for random addresses, prevent signature replay, and allow invalidating signatures. Add `voter` as a new parameter in the `castVoteBySig` and `castVoteWithReasonAndParamsBySig` functions. ([#4378](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4378))
- `Governor`: Added support for casting votes with ERC-1271 signatures by using a `bytes memory signature` instead of `r`, `s` and `v` arguments in the `castVoteBySig` and `castVoteWithReasonAndParamsBySig` functions. ([#4418](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4418))
- `Governor`: Added a mechanism to restrict the address of the proposer using a suffix in the description.
- `GovernorStorage`: Added a new governor extension that stores the proposal details in storage, with an interface that operates on `proposalId`, as well as proposal enumerability. This replaces the old `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` module. ([#4360](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4360))
- `GovernorTimelockAccess`: Added a module to connect a governor with an instance of `AccessManager`, allowing the governor to make calls that are delay-restricted by the manager using the normal `queue` workflow. ([#4523](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4523))
- `GovernorTimelockControl`: Clean up timelock id on execution for gas refund. ([#4118](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4118))
- `GovernorTimelockControl`: Added the Governor instance address as part of the TimelockController operation `salt` to avoid operation id collisions between governors using the same TimelockController. ([#4432](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4432))
- `TimelockController`: Changed the role architecture to use `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` as the admin for all roles, instead of the bespoke `TIMELOCK_ADMIN_ROLE` that was used previously. This aligns with the general recommendation for `AccessControl` and makes the addition of new roles easier. Accordingly, the `admin` parameter and timelock will now be granted `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` instead of `TIMELOCK_ADMIN_ROLE`. ([#3799](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3799))
- `TimelockController`: Added a state getter that returns an `OperationState` enum. ([#4358](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4358))
- `Votes`: Use Trace208 for checkpoints. This enables EIP-6372 clock support for keys but reduces the max supported voting power to uint208. ([#4539](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4539))

#### Metatx

- `ERC2771Forwarder`: Added `deadline` for expiring transactions, batching, and more secure handling of `msg.value`. ([#4346](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4346))
- `ERC2771Context`: Return the forwarder address whenever the `msg.data` of a call originating from a trusted forwarder is not long enough to contain the request signer address (i.e. `msg.data.length` is less than 20 bytes), as specified by ERC-2771. ([#4481](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4481))
- `ERC2771Context`: Prevent revert in `_msgData()` when a call originating from a trusted forwarder is not long enough to contain the request signer address (i.e. `msg.data.length` is less than 20 bytes). Return the full calldata in that case. ([#4484](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4484))

#### Proxy

- `ProxyAdmin`: Removed `getProxyAdmin` and `getProxyImplementation` getters. ([#3820](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3820))
- `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`: Removed `admin` and `implementation` getters, which were only callable by the proxy owner and thus not very useful. ([#3820](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3820))
- `ERC1967Utils`: Refactored the `ERC1967Upgrade` abstract contract as a library. ([#4325](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4325))
- `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`: Admin is now stored in an immutable variable (set during construction) to avoid unnecessary storage reads on every proxy call. This removed the ability to ever change the admin. Transfer of the upgrade capability is exclusively handled through the ownership of the `ProxyAdmin`. ([#4354](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4354))
- Moved the logic to validate ERC-1822 during an upgrade from `ERC1967Utils` to `UUPSUpgradeable`. ([#4356](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4356))
- `UUPSUpgradeable`, `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` and `ProxyAdmin`: Removed `upgradeTo` and `upgrade` functions, and made `upgradeToAndCall` and `upgradeAndCall` ignore the data argument if it is empty. It is no longer possible to invoke the receive function (or send value with empty data) along with an upgrade. ([#4382](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4382))
- `BeaconProxy`: Reject value in initialization unless a payable function is explicitly invoked. ([#4382](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4382))
- `Proxy`: Removed redundant `receive` function. ([#4434](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4434))
- `BeaconProxy`: Use an immutable variable to store the address of the beacon. It is no longer possible for a `BeaconProxy` to upgrade by changing to another beacon. ([#4435](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4435))
- `Initializable`: Use the namespaced storage pattern to avoid putting critical variables in slot 0. Allow reinitializer versions greater than 256. ([#4460](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4460))
- `Initializable`: Use intermediate variables to improve readability. ([#4576](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4576))

#### Token

- `ERC20`, `ERC721`, `ERC1155`: Deleted `_beforeTokenTransfer` and `_afterTokenTransfer` hooks, added a new internal `_update` function for customizations, and refactored all extensions using those hooks to use `_update` instead. ([#3838](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3838), [#3876](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3876), [#4377](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4377))
- `ERC20`: Removed `Approval` event previously emitted in `transferFrom` to indicate that part of the allowance was consumed. With this change, allowances are no longer reconstructible from events. See the code for guidelines on how to re-enable this event if needed. ([#4370](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4370))
- `ERC20`: Removed the non-standard `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions. ([#4585](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4585))
- `ERC20Votes`: Changed internal vote accounting to reusable `Votes` module previously used by `ERC721Votes`. Removed implicit `ERC20Permit` inheritance. Note that the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` getter was previously guaranteed to be available for `ERC20Votes` contracts, but is no longer available unless `ERC20Permit` is explicitly used; ERC-5267 support is included in `ERC20Votes` with `EIP712` and is recommended as an alternative. ([#3816](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3816))
- `SafeERC20`: Refactored `safeDecreaseAllowance` and `safeIncreaseAllowance` to support USDT-like tokens. ([#4260](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4260))
- `SafeERC20`: Removed `safePermit` in favor of documentation-only `permit` recommendations. Based on recommendations from [@trust1995](https://github.com/trust1995) ([#4582](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4582))
- `ERC721`: `_approve` no longer allows approving the owner of the tokenId. ([#4377](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4377)) `_setApprovalForAll` no longer allows setting address(0) as an operator. ([#4377](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4377))
- `ERC721`: Renamed `_requireMinted` to `_requireOwned` and added a return value with the current owner. Implemented `ownerOf` in terms of `_requireOwned`. ([#4566](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4566))
- `ERC721Consecutive`: Added a `_firstConsecutiveId` internal function that can be overridden to change the id of the first token minted through `_mintConsecutive`. ([#4097](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4097))
- `ERC721URIStorage`: Allow setting the token URI prior to minting. ([#4559](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4559))
- `ERC721URIStorage`, `ERC721Royalty`: Stop resetting token-specific URI and royalties when burning. ([#4561](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4561))
- `ERC1155`: Optimized array allocation. ([#4196](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4196))
- `ERC1155`: Removed check for address zero in `balanceOf`. ([#4263](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4263))
- `ERC1155`: Optimized array accesses by skipping bounds checking when unnecessary. ([#4300](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4300))
- `ERC1155`: Bubble errors triggered in the `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived` hooks. ([#4314](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4314))
- `ERC1155Supply`: Added a `totalSupply()` function that returns the total amount of token circulating, this change will restrict the total tokens minted across all ids to 2**256-1 . ([#3962](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3962))
- `ERC1155Receiver`: Removed in favor of `ERC1155Holder`. ([#4450](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4450))

#### Utils

- `Address`: Removed the ability to customize error messages. A common custom error is always used if the underlying revert reason cannot be bubbled up. ([#4502](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4502))
- `Arrays`: Added `unsafeMemoryAccess` helpers to read from a memory array without checking the length. ([#4300](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4300))
- `Arrays`: Optimized `findUpperBound` by removing redundant SLOAD. ([#4442](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4442))
- `Checkpoints`: Library moved from `utils` to `utils/structs` ([#4275](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4275))
- `DoubleEndedQueue`: Refactored internal structure to use `uint128` instead of `int128`. This has no effect on the library interface. ([#4150](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4150))
- `ECDSA`: Use unchecked arithmetic for the `tryRecover` function that receives the `r` and `vs` short-signature fields separately. ([#4301](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4301))
- `EIP712`: Added internal getters for the name and version strings ([#4303](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4303))
- `Math`: Makes `ceilDiv` to revert on 0 division even if the numerator is 0 ([#4348](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4348))
- `Math`: Optimized stack operations in `mulDiv`. ([#4494](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4494))
- `Math`: Renamed members of `Rounding` enum, and added a new rounding mode for "away from zero". ([#4455](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4455))
- `MerkleProof`: Use custom error to report invalid multiproof instead of reverting with overflow panic. ([#4564](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4564))
- `MessageHashUtils`: Added a new library for creating message digest to be used along with signing or recovery such as ECDSA or ERC-1271. These functions are moved from the `ECDSA` library. ([#4430](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4430))
- `Nonces`: Added a new contract to keep track of user nonces. Used for signatures in `ERC20Permit`, `ERC20Votes`, and `ERC721Votes`. ([#3816](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3816))
- `ReentrancyGuard`, `Pausable`: Moved to `utils` directory. ([#4551](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4551))
- `Strings`: Renamed `toString(int256)` to `toStringSigned(int256)`. ([#4330](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4330))
- Optimized `Strings.equal` ([#4262](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4262))

### How to migrate from 4.x

#### ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155

These breaking changes will require modifications to ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 contracts, since the `_afterTokenTransfer` and `_beforeTokenTransfer` functions were removed. Thus, any customization made through those hooks should now be done overriding the new `_update` function instead.

Minting and burning are implemented by `_update` and customizations should be done by overriding this function as well. `_transfer`, `_mint` and `_burn` are no longer virtual (meaning they are not overridable) to guard against possible inconsistencies.

For example, a contract using `ERC20`'s `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook would have to be changed in the following way.

```diff
-function _beforeTokenTransfer(
+function _update(
   address from,
   address to,
   uint256 amount
 ) internal virtual override {
-  super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
   require(!condition(), "ERC20: wrong condition");
+  super._update(from, to, amount);
 }
```

#### More about ERC721

In the case of `ERC721`, the `_update` function does not include a `from` parameter, as the sender is implicitly the previous owner of the `tokenId`. The address of this previous owner is returned by the `_update` function, so it can be used for a posteriori checks. In addition to `to` and `tokenId`, a third parameter (`auth`) is present in this function. This parameter enabled an optional check that the caller/spender is approved to do the transfer. This check cannot be performed after the transfer (because the transfer resets the approval), and doing it before `_update` would require a duplicate call to `_ownerOf`.

In this logic of removing hidden SLOADs, the `_isApprovedOrOwner` function was removed in favor of a new `_isAuthorized` function. Overrides that used to target the `_isApprovedOrOwner` should now be performed on the `_isAuthorized` function. Calls to `_isApprovedOrOwner` that preceded a call to `_transfer`, `_burn` or `_approve` should be removed in favor of using the `auth` argument in `_update` and `_approve`. This is showcased in `ERC721Burnable.burn` and in `ERC721Wrapper.withdrawTo`.

The `_exists` function was removed. Calls to this function can be replaced by `_ownerOf(tokenId) != address(0)`.

#### More about ERC1155

Batch transfers will now emit `TransferSingle` if the batch consists of a single token, while in previous versions the `TransferBatch` event would be used for all transfers initiated through `safeBatchTransferFrom`. Both behaviors are compliant with the ERC-1155 specification.

#### ERC165Storage

Users that were registering EIP-165 interfaces with `_registerInterface` from `ERC165Storage` should instead do so so by overriding the `supportsInterface` function as seen below:

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override returns (bool) {
  return interfaceId == type(MyInterface).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
}
```

#### SafeMath

Methods in SafeMath superseded by native overflow checks in Solidity 0.8.0 were removed along with operations providing an interface for revert strings. The remaining methods were moved to `utils/Math.sol`.

```diff
- import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";
+ import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol";

 function tryOperations(uint256 x, uint256 y) external view {
-  (bool overflowsAdd, uint256 resultAdd) = SafeMath.tryAdd(x, y);
+  (bool overflowsAdd, uint256 resultAdd) = Math.tryAdd(x, y);
-  (bool overflowsSub, uint256 resultSub) = SafeMath.trySub(x, y);
+  (bool overflowsSub, uint256 resultSub) = Math.trySub(x, y);
-  (bool overflowsMul, uint256 resultMul) = SafeMath.tryMul(x, y);
+  (bool overflowsMul, uint256 resultMul) = Math.tryMul(x, y);
-  (bool overflowsDiv, uint256 resultDiv) = SafeMath.tryDiv(x, y);
+  (bool overflowsDiv, uint256 resultDiv) = Math.tryDiv(x, y);
   // ...
 }
```

#### Adapting Governor modules

Custom Governor modules that override internal functions may require modifications if migrated to v5. In particular, the new internal functions `_queueOperations` and `_executeOperations` may need to be used. If assistance with this migration is needed reach out via the [OpenZeppelin Support Forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/c/support/contracts/18).

#### ECDSA and MessageHashUtils

The `ECDSA` library is now focused on signer recovery. Previously it also included utility methods for producing digests to be used with signing or recovery. These utilities have been moved to the `MessageHashUtils` library and should be imported if needed:

```diff
 import {ECDSA} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol";
+import {MessageHashUtils} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/MessageHashUtils.sol";

 contract Verifier {
   using ECDSA for bytes32;
+  using MessageHashUtils for bytes32;

   function _verify(bytes32 data, bytes memory signature, address account) internal pure returns (bool) {
     return data
       .toEthSignedMessageHash()
       .recover(signature) == account;
   }
 }
```

#### Interfaces and libraries in upgradeable contracts

The upgradeable version of the contracts library used to include a variant suffixed with `Upgradeable` for every contract. These variants, which are produced automatically, mainly include changes for dealing with storage that don't apply to libraries and interfaces.

The upgradeable library no longer includes upgradeable variants for libraries and interfaces. Projects migrating to 5.0 should replace their library and interface imports with their corresponding non-upgradeable version:

```diff
 // Libraries
-import {AddressUpgradeable} from '@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol';
+import {Address} from '@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol';

 // Interfaces
-import {IERC20Upgradeable} from '@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/interfaces/IERC20.sol';
+import {IERC20} from '@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC20.sol';
```

#### Offchain Considerations

Some changes may affect offchain systems if they rely on assumptions that are changed along with these new breaking changes. These cases are:

##### Relying on revert strings for processing errors

A concrete example is AccessControl, where it was previously advised to catch revert reasons using the following regex:

```
/^AccessControl: account (0x[0-9a-f]{40}) is missing role (0x[0-9a-f]{64})$/
```

Instead, contracts now revert with custom errors. Systems that interact with smart contracts outside of the network should consider reliance on revert strings and possibly support the new custom errors.

##### Relying on storage locations for retrieving data

After 5.0, the storage location of some variables were changed. This is the case for `Initializable` and all the upgradeable contracts since they now use namespaced storaged locations. Any system relying on storage locations for retrieving data or detecting capabilities should be updated to support these new locations.

- `MerkleProof`: optimize by using unchecked arithmetic. ([#3745](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3745))

### Breaking changes

- `EIP712`: Addition of ERC5267 support requires support for user defined value types, which was released in Solidity version 0.8.8. This requires a pragma change from `^0.8.0` to `^0.8.8`.
- `EIP712`: Optimization of the cache for the upgradeable version affects the way `name` and `version` are set. This is no longer done through an initializer, and is instead part of the implementation's constructor. As a consequence, all proxies using the same implementation will necessarily share the same `name` and `version`. Additionally, an implementation upgrade risks changing the EIP712 domain unless the same `name` and `version` are used when deploying the new implementation contract.

### Deprecations

- `ERC20Permit`: Added the file `IERC20Permit.sol` and `ERC20Permit.sol` and deprecated `draft-IERC20Permit.sol` and `draft-ERC20Permit.sol` since [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) is no longer a Draft. Developers are encouraged to update their imports. ([#3793](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3793))
- `Timers`: The `Timers` library is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. ([#4062](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4062))
- `ERC777`: The `ERC777` token standard is no longer supported by OpenZeppelin. Our implementation is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. The corresponding standard interfaces remain available. ([#4066](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4066))
- `ERC1820Implementer`: The `ERC1820` pseudo-introspection mechanism is no longer supported by OpenZeppelin. Our implementation is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. The corresponding standard interfaces remain available. ([#4066](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4066))

# [v4.8.3](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.8.3) - 2023-04-13

> **Note**
> This release contains fixes for https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-mx2q-35m2-x2rh and https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-93hq-5wgc-jc82.

- `GovernorCompatibilityBravo`: Fix encoding of proposal data when signatures are missing.
- `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`: Fix transparency in case of selector clash with non-decodable calldata or payable mutability. ([#4154](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4154))

# [v4.8.2](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.8.2) - 2023-03-02

> **Note**
> This release contains a fix for https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-878m-3g6q-594q.

- `ERC721Consecutive`: Fixed a bug when `_mintConsecutive` is used for batches of size 1 that could lead to balance overflow. Refer to the breaking changes section in the changelog for a note on the behavior of `ERC721._beforeTokenTransfer`.

### Breaking changes

- `ERC721`: The internal function `_beforeTokenTransfer` no longer updates balances, which it previously did when `batchSize` was greater than 1. This change has no consequence unless a custom ERC721 extension is explicitly invoking `_beforeTokenTransfer`. Balance updates in extensions must now be done explicitly using `__unsafe_increaseBalance`, with a name that indicates that there is an invariant that has to be manually verified.

 * Arbitrum: Update the vendored arbitrum contracts to match the nitro upgrade. ([#3692](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3692))

### Breaking changes

 * `ERC721`: In order to add support for batch minting via `ERC721Consecutive` it was necessary to make a minor breaking change in the internal interface of `ERC721`. Namely, the hooks `_beforeTokenTransfer` and `_afterTokenTransfer` have one additional argument that may need to be added to overrides:

```diff
 function _beforeTokenTransfer(
     address from,
     address to,
     uint256 tokenId,
+    uint256 batchSize
 ) internal virtual override
```

 * `ERC4626`: Conversion from shares to assets (and vice-versa) in an empty vault used to consider the possible mismatch between the underlying asset's and the vault's decimals. This initial conversion rate is now set to 1-to-1 irrespective of decimals, which are meant for usability purposes only. The vault now uses the assets decimals by default, so off-chain the numbers should appear the same. Developers overriding the vault decimals to a value that does not match the underlying asset may want to override the `_initialConvertToShares` and `_initialConvertToAssets` to replicate the previous behavior.

 * `TimelockController`: During deployment, the TimelockController used to grant the `TIMELOCK_ADMIN_ROLE` to the deployer and to the timelock itself. The deployer was then expected to renounce this role once configuration of the timelock is over. Failing to renounce that role allows the deployer to change the timelock permissions (but not to bypass the delay for any time-locked actions). The role is no longer given to the deployer by default. A new parameter `admin` can be set to a non-zero address to grant the admin role during construction (to the deployer or any other address). Just like previously, this admin role should be renounced after configuration. If this param is given `address(0)`, the role is not allocated and doesn't need to be revoked. In any case, the timelock itself continues to have this role.

### Deprecations

 * `EIP712`: Added the file `EIP712.sol` and deprecated `draft-EIP712.sol` since the EIP is no longer a Draft. Developers are encouraged to update their imports. ([#3621](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3621))

```diff
-import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/draft-EIP712.sol";
+import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol";
```

 * `ERC721Votes`: Added the file `ERC721Votes.sol` and deprecated `draft-ERC721Votes.sol` since it no longer depends on a Draft EIP (EIP-712). Developers are encouraged to update their imports. ([#3699](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3699))

```diff
-import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/draft-ERC721Votes.sol";
+import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Votes.sol";
```

### ERC-721 Compatibility Note

ERC-721 integrators that interpret contract state from events should make sure that they implement the clearing of approval that is implicit in every transfer according to the EIP. Previous versions of OpenZeppelin Contracts emitted an explicit `Approval` event even though it was not required by the specification, and this is no longer the case.

With the new `ERC721Consecutive` extension, the internal workings of `ERC721` are slightly changed. Custom extensions to ERC721 should be reviewed to ensure they remain correct. The internal functions that should be considered are `_ownerOf` (new), `_beforeTokenTransfer`, and `_afterTokenTransfer`.

 * `AccessControl`: add a virtual `_checkRole(bytes32)` function that can be overridden to alter the `onlyRole` modifier behavior. ([#3137](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3137))
 * `EnumerableMap`: add new `AddressToUintMap` map type. ([#3150](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3150))
 * `EnumerableMap`: add new `Bytes32ToBytes32Map` map type. ([#3192](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3192))
 * `ERC20FlashMint`: support infinite allowance when paying back a flash loan. ([#3226](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3226))
 * `ERC20Wrapper`: the `decimals()` function now tries to fetch the value from the underlying token instance. If that calls revert, then the default value is used. ([#3259](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3259))
 * `draft-ERC20Permit`: replace `immutable` with `constant` for `_PERMIT_TYPEHASH` since the `keccak256` of string literals is treated specially and the hash is evaluated at compile time. ([#3196](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3196))
 * `ERC1155`: Add a `_afterTokenTransfer` hook for improved extensibility. ([#3166](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3166))
 * `ERC1155URIStorage`: add a new extension that implements a `_setURI` behavior similar to ERC721's `_setTokenURI`. ([#3210](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3210))
 * `DoubleEndedQueue`: a new data structure that supports efficient push and pop to both front and back, useful for FIFO and LIFO queues. ([#3153](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3153))
 * `Governor`: improved security of `onlyGovernance` modifier when using an external executor contract (e.g. a timelock) that can operate without necessarily going through the governance protocol. ([#3147](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3147))
 * `Governor`: Add a way to parameterize votes. This can be used to implement voting systems such as fractionalized voting, ERC721 based voting, or any number of other systems. The `params` argument added to `_countVote` method, and included in the newly added `_getVotes` method, can be used by counting and voting modules respectively for such purposes. ([#3043](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3043))
 * `Governor`: rewording of revert reason for consistency. ([#3275](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3275))
 * `Governor`: fix an inconsistency in data locations that could lead to invalid bytecode being produced. ([#3295](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3295))
 * `Governor`: Implement `IERC721Receiver` and `IERC1155Receiver` to improve token custody by governors. ([#3230](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3230))
 * `TimelockController`: Implement `IERC721Receiver` and `IERC1155Receiver` to improve token custody by timelocks. ([#3230](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3230))
 * `TimelockController`: Add a separate canceller role for the ability to cancel. ([#3165](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3165))
 * `Initializable`: add a reinitializer modifier that enables the initialization of new modules, added to already initialized contracts through upgradeability. ([#3232](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3232))
 * `Initializable`: add an Initialized event that tracks initialized version numbers. ([#3294](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3294))
 * `ERC2981`: make `royaltiInfo` public to allow super call in overrides. ([#3305](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3305))

### Upgradeability notice

* `TimelockController`: **(Action needed)** The upgrade from `<4.6 to >=4.6` introduces a new `CANCELLER_ROLE` that requires set up to be assignable. After the upgrade, only addresses with this role will have the ability to cancel. Proposers will no longer be able to cancel. Assigning cancellers can be done by an admin (including the timelock itself) once the role admin is set up. To do this, we recommend upgrading to the `TimelockControllerWith46MigrationUpgradeable` contract and then calling the `migrateTo46` function.

### Breaking changes

* `Governor`: Adds internal virtual `_getVotes` method that must be implemented; this is a breaking change for existing concrete extensions to `Governor`. To fix this on an existing voting module extension, rename `getVotes` to `_getVotes` and add a `bytes memory` argument. ([#3043](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3043))
* `Governor`: Adds `params` parameter to internal virtual `_countVote ` method; this is a breaking change for existing concrete extensions to `Governor`. To fix this on an existing counting module extension, add a `bytes memory` argument to `_countVote`. ([#3043](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3043))
* `Governor`: Does not emit `VoteCast` event when params data is non-empty; instead emits `VoteCastWithParams` event. To fix this on an integration that consumes the `VoteCast` event, also fetch/monitor `VoteCastWithParams` events. ([#3043](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3043))
* `Votes`: The internal virtual function `_getVotingUnits` was made `view` (which was accidentally missing). Any overrides should now be updated so they are `view` as well.


[Changes][v4.6.0]


<a id="v4.5.0"></a>
# [v4.5.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.5.0) - 2022-02-09

 * `ERC2981`: add implementation of the royalty standard, and the respective extensions for `ERC721` and `ERC1155`. ([#3012](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3012))
 * `GovernorTimelockControl`: improve the `state()` function to have it reflect cases where a proposal has been canceled directly on the timelock. ([#2977](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2977))
 * Preset contracts are now deprecated in favor of [Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com). ([#2986](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2986))
 * `Governor`: add a relay function to help recover assets sent to a governor that is not its own executor (e.g. when using a timelock). ([#2926](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2926))
 * `GovernorPreventLateQuorum`: add new module to ensure a minimum voting duration is available after the quorum is reached. ([#2973](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2973))
 * `ERC721`: improved revert reason when transferring from wrong owner. ([#2975](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2975))
 * `Votes`: Added a base contract for vote tracking with delegation. ([#2944](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2944))
 * `ERC721Votes`: Added an extension of ERC721 enabled with vote tracking and delegation. ([#2944](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2944))
 * `ERC2771Context`: use immutable storage to store the forwarder address, no longer an issue since Solidity >=0.8.8 allows reading immutable variables in the constructor. ([#2917](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2917))
 * `Base64`: add a library to parse bytes into base64 strings using `encode(bytes memory)` function, and provide examples to show how to use to build URL-safe `tokenURIs`. ([#2884](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2884))
 * `ERC20`: reduce allowance before triggering transfer. ([#3056](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3056))
 * `ERC20`: do not update allowance on `transferFrom` when allowance is `type(uint256).max`. ([#3085](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3085))
 * `ERC20`: add a `_spendAllowance` internal function. ([#3170](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3170))
 * `ERC20Burnable`: do not update allowance on `burnFrom` when allowance is `type(uint256).max`. ([#3170](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3170))
 * `ERC777`: do not update allowance on `transferFrom` when allowance is `type(uint256).max`. ([#3085](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3085))
 * `ERC777`: add a `_spendAllowance` internal function. ([#3170](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3170))
 * `SignedMath`: a new signed version of the Math library with `max`, `min`,  and `average`. ([#2686](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2686))
 * `SignedMath`: add a `abs(int256)` method that returns the unsigned absolute value of a signed value. ([#2984](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2984))
 * `ERC1967Upgrade`: Refactor the secure upgrade to use `ERC1822` instead of the previous rollback mechanism. This reduces code complexity and attack surface with similar security guarantees. ([#3021](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3021))
 * `UUPSUpgradeable`: Add `ERC1822` compliance to support the updated secure upgrade mechanism. ([#3021](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3021))
 * Some more functions have been made virtual to customize them via overrides. In many cases this will not imply that other functions in the contract will automatically adapt to the overridden definitions. People who wish to override should consult the source code to understand the impact and if they need to override any additional functions to achieve the desired behavior.

### Breaking changes

* `ERC1967Upgrade`: The function `_upgradeToAndCallSecure` was renamed to `_upgradeToAndCallUUPS`, along with the change in security mechanism described above.
* `Address`: The Solidity pragma is increased from `^0.8.0` to `^0.8.1`. This is required by the `account.code.length` syntax that replaces inline assembly. This may require users to bump their compiler version from `0.8.0` to `0.8.1` or later. Note that other parts of the code already include stricter requirements.

:warning: This is a patch for a low severity vulnerability. For more information [visit the security advisory](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-9c22-pwxw-p6hx).

 * `Initializable`: change the existing `initializer` modifier and add a new `onlyInitializing` modifier to prevent reentrancy risk. ([#3006](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3006))

### Breaking change

It is no longer possible to call an `initializer`-protected function from within another `initializer` function outside the context of a constructor. Projects using OpenZeppelin upgradeable proxies should continue to work as is, since in the common case the initializer is invoked in the constructor directly. If this is not the case for you, the suggested change is to use the new `onlyInitializing` modifier in the following way:

```diff
 contract A {
-    function initialize() public   initializer { ... }
+    function initialize() internal onlyInitializing { ... }
 }
 contract B is A {
     function initialize() public initializer {
         A.initialize();
     }
 }
```

Read the full announcement [in the blog](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/openzeppelin-contracts-4-0/) or check out the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#400-2021-03-23).

## Changelog

 * Now targeting the 0.8.x line of Solidity compilers. For 0.6.x (resp 0.7.x) support, use version 3.4.0 (resp 3.4.0-solc-0.7) of OpenZeppelin.
 * `Context`: making `_msgData` return `bytes calldata` instead of `bytes memory` ([#2492](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2492))
 * `ERC20`: removed the `_setDecimals` function and the storage slot associated to decimals. ([#2502](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2502))
 * `Strings`: addition of a `toHexString` function.  ([#2504](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2504))
 * `EnumerableMap`: change implementation to optimize for `key → value` lookups instead of enumeration. ([#2518](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2518))
 * `GSN`: deprecate GSNv1 support in favor of upcoming support for GSNv2. ([#2521](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2521))
 * `ERC165`: remove uses of storage in the base ERC165 implementation. ERC165 based contracts now use storage-less virtual functions. Old behavior remains available in the `ERC165Storage` extension. ([#2505](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2505))
 * `Initializable`: make initializer check stricter during construction. ([#2531](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2531))
 * `ERC721`: remove enumerability of tokens from the base implementation. This feature is now provided separately through the `ERC721Enumerable` extension. ([#2511](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2511))
 * `AccessControl`: removed enumerability by default for a more lightweight contract. It is now opt-in through `AccessControlEnumerable`. ([#2512](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2512))
 * Meta Transactions: add `ERC2771Context` and a `MinimalForwarder` for meta-transactions. ([#2508](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2508))
 * Overall reorganization of the contract folder to improve clarity and discoverability. ([#2503](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2503))
 * `ERC20Capped`: optimize gas usage by enforcing the check directly in `_mint`. ([#2524](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2524))
 * Rename `UpgradeableProxy` to `ERC1967Proxy`. ([#2547](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2547))
 * `ERC777`: optimize the gas costs of the constructor. ([#2551](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2551))
 * `ERC721URIStorage`: add a new extension that implements the `_setTokenURI` behavior as it was available in 3.4.0. ([#2555](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2555))
 * `AccessControl`: added ERC165 interface detection. ([#2562](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2562))
 * `ERC1155`: make `uri` public so overloading function can call it using super. ([#2576](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2576))

### How to upgrade from 3.x

Since this version has moved a few contracts to different directories, users upgrading from a previous version will need to adjust their import statements. To make this easier, the package includes a script that will migrate import statements automatically. After upgrading to the latest version of the package, run:

```
npx openzeppelin-contracts-migrate-imports
```

Make sure you're using git or another version control system to be able to recover from any potential error in our script.

# [v3.2.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v3.2.0) - 2020-09-11

Welcome to a new release of OpenZeppelin Contracts! :dancers:

The big feature in this release is that we’ve migrated our proxy contracts from OpenZeppelin SDK into the Contracts project. We hope this will make more people aware of upgrades in Ethereum, and we also think the contracts will benefit greatly from the continued scrutiny by all of you in the community. This was also a migration of the proxies from Solidity 0.5 to 0.6, which we know some users have been waiting for.

> For Solidity 0.7 users, a reminder that we have support for the newer compiler version published on npm under the tag `solc-0.7`, the latest release being `3.2.0-solc-0.7`. We’re considering officially switching to 0.7 for the release after this one.

There is additionally a small breaking change in `ERC20Snapshot` that may affect some of its users. If you’re one of them please take a look at [the changelog](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#320-2020-09-10).

[Changes][v3.2.0]


<a id="v3.1.0"></a>
# [v3.1.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v3.1.0) - 2020-06-29


This is the first release since [v3.0, our last major release](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/openzeppelin-contracts-v3-0/2695). It includes the long-awaited **ERC1155 token** and helpers for **safe calls and downcasts**, as well as a number of minor improvements.

To install this release, run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/contracts
```

## ERC1155

This is a new [token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) developed by the gaming industry, focusing on gas efficiency. It's key difference is that it is a _multi-token_ contract: a single ERC1155 can be used to represent an arbitrary number of tokens, which is very useful in applications that require many tokens by removing the high gas costs associated with deploying them. Check out our new [documentation page](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc1155) to learn more!.

## More Replacements for `call`

The low-level `call` primitive can be hard to use correctly and is often considered unsafe. With the addition of [`sendValue`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/utils#Address-sendValue-address-payable-uint256-) in Contracts and `try-catch` in Solidity, there's only a few scenarios in which `call` is still needed, the most troublesome one being forwarding calls.

The new [`functionCall`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/utils.html#Address-functionCall-address-bytes-) helpers can forward call data to a recipient contract while imitating Solidity's function call semantics, such as bubbling up revert reasons and rejecting calls to EOAs. We expect the addition of these functions to greatly reduce the need to rely on `call`.

## Using `SafeMath` on Small Signed Integers

We've expanded the scope of the [`SafeCast`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/utils#SafeCast) library to also include signed integer downcasting, which allows for users that need small types (such as `int8` or `int32`) to perform checked arithmetic on them by using `SafeMath`, and then downcast the result to the intended size.

# [OpenZeppelin Contracts 3.0.1 (v3.0.1)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v3.0.1) - 2020-04-27

This is a small bugfix release, addressing an issue that allowed for some `internal` functions in ERC777 to be called with the zero address as one of their arguments.

This was reported in [#2208](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/2208), fixed in [#2212](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2212) for the v2.5 branch, and ported to the v3.0 branch in [#2213](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2213).

# [OpenZeppelin Contracts 3.0 (v3.0.0)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v3.0.0) - 2020-04-20

We're thrilled to finally announce the **release of OpenZeppelin Contracts v3.0** :sparkles:

Among other things, this release features the **migration to Solidity v0.6**, as well as a **revamped access control system**, **streamlined token contracts**, and new libraries for **enumerable mappings**.

To install this latest release, run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/contracts
```

## What's New

 * All contracts were migrated to Solidity v0.6.
 * `AccessControl` was designed [with help from the community](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/redesigning-accesscontrol-for-the-openzeppelin-contracts/2177) and has replaced `Roles` contracts (such as `MinterRole` and `PauserRole`), which were removed.
 * Crowdsales were removed: we'll continue to provide support for security issues on the v2.5 release, but will not bring them over to v3.0.
 * We've added **hooks**, a new feature of the library that will make extending it easier than ever.
 * `ERC20` and `ERC721` were simplified and streamlined, including all optional parts of the standard by default, and simplifying some of our own custom extensions.
 * Support for better `mapping` types that let you efficiently iterate over all keys using `EnumerableSet` and `EnumerableMap`
 * Many, _many_ breaking changes with small improvements. We've also moved some contracts around (e.g. `Ownable` is now found under the `access` directory) and deleted some that were not being used. Head to our [changelog](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to see the full list.

## Compiling v0.6 Contracts

You can use the [**OpenZeppelin CLI**](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/cli) to compile any Solidity v0.6 contract: just update the `pragma` statement on your source code and you'll be good to go!

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
```

Note that you will need to use the [v2.7 release of the CLI](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/openzeppelin-cli-2-7/2252) or newer to have Solidity v0.6 support. For detailed information about using the CLI compiler, head to its [documenation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/cli/compiling).

## Revamped Access Control

One of our most widely-used contracts is [`Ownable`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/access#Ownable), providing a simple authorization scheme. However, this fell short in complex systems with [multiple permissions](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/366).

The v3.0 release introduces `AccessControl`, a one-stop-shop for all authorization needs. It lets you easily define multiple **roles with different permissions**, as well as **which accounts are allowed to grant and revoke** each role. It also boosts transparency by enabling **enumeration of all privileged accounts** in a system.

`AccessControl` was designed with a security-first mindset, [receiving input from a wide array of users](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/redesigning-accesscontrol-for-the-openzeppelin-contracts/2177) and incorporating best practices in the field. Head to [our Access Control guide](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/access-control#role-based-access-control) for more information!

## Preset Contracts

OpenZeppelin Contracts shine when you need the building blocks to get to the right feature set, but that's not all they can do! We've added a new family of **Preset** contracts starting with ERC20 and ERC721 tokens that you can quickly deploy as-is **without having to write any Solidity code**. Check out [their documentation!](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/presets)

## Migrating From OpenZeppelin Contracts v2.5

Other than the moved and deleted contracts mentioned above, the library API is pretty much the same as in the [v2.5 release](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/openzeppelin-contracts-v2-5/2155), so the migration should be straightforward. For instructions on how to update your Solidity v0.5 contracts to v0.6, refer to the [official documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/060-breaking-changes.html#how-to-update-your-code).

If you're using the `ERC20` or `ERC721` tokens however, you'll have to remove all references to optional extensions (`ERC20Detailed`, `ERC721Enumerable`, etc.) - these have been included in the base contracts.

The other exception to this are contracts that use the [**Gas Station Network (GSN)**](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/gsn): if you're inheriting from `GSNRecipient` or one of the other GSN contracts, you'll need to add the following snippet to your contracts:

```solidity
function _msgSender() internal view override(Context, GSNRecipient) returns (address payable) {
    return GSNRecipient._msgSender();
}

function _msgData() internal view override(Context, GSNRecipient) returns (bytes memory) {
    return GSNRecipient._msgData();
}
```

## Using Hooks

To improve library flexibility, we're introducing **hooks**: functions that are called at specific moments during a contract's operation that you can use to _hook_ into the internals and extend as you wish.

For example, the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook in ERC20, ERC721 and ERC777 makes it very easy to add additional checks or actions to execute whenever tokens are transferred, minted or burned, regardless of what prompted it.

```bash
// Tokens can only be transferred, minted or burned if the contract is not paused
contract ERC20Pausable is ERC20, Pausable {
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        internal virtual override
    {
        super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);

        require(!paused(), "ERC20Pausable: token transfer while paused");
    }
}
```

As an additional benefit, using hooks will allow you to side-step some of the [edge-cases product of the new `override` keyword](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8141).

Head over to our [brand new guide on Extending the OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/extending-contracts) to learn more!

## What's Next

We've started work in some exciting features for the upcoming releases, including **fixed-point arithmetic** and the **ERC1155 token standard**. To read more and find out how you can contribute, check out our [Q2 2020 roadmap](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/2207)!

<a id="v2.5.0"></a>
# [OpenZeppelin Contracts 2.5 (v2.5.0)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v2.5.0) - 2020-02-05

We're very happy the announce the release of **OpenZeppelin Contracts v2.5**!

This new release features:
  - **`EnumerableSet`**: similar to Solidity's `mapping`, but that lets you retrieve all the keys! Useful for dapps that need to display a set of accounts with some property, and cannot rely on events alone.
  -  **`Create2`**: a simple library for using the [CREATE2 opcode](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014), allowing for deployment and pre-computation of addresses when using it.
_To learn more about all the cool things you can do with it, head to [Getting the Most out of CREATE2](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/getting-the-most-out-of-create2/)_
  - **`ERC721Metadata.baseURI`**: a neat extension for _massive_ gas savings when the token URIs share a prefix, like `https://my.cool.app/token/<id>`

There are also some minor improvements, such as gas optimizations for `ReentrancyGuard` and additional extensibility of `ERC777`, among others.

_For the complete list of changes, head to our [changelog](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)._

To install the new release, run:

```bash
$ npm install @openzeppelin/contracts@latest
```

## New Documentation :books:

We've also recently done some some improvements to our [documentation website](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/revamped-documentation-site/2056), including [new detailed guides](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/) and documentation for our other tools, such as the [**Test Helpers**](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/test-helpers/0.5/), our blazing-fast [**Test Environment**](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/test-environment/0.1/) and the [**OpenZeppelin Command Line Interface**](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/cli/2.6/). Check them out for a radically better development experience!

## Saying Goodbye to Solidity v0.5 :wave:

December 2019 saw the [release of Solidity v0.6](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.6.0). This new version of the language has major improvements, and we're already underway to **release the next version of OpenZeppelin Contracts with support for Solidity v0.6**.

However, it also includes _a lot_ of breaking changes, making it difficult to support both v0.5 and v0.6 code at the same time. For this reason, we've decided OpenZeppelin Contracts v2.5 will be the **last version supporting Solidity v0.5**.

The exciting good news it that the next OpenZeppelin Contracts release will be v3.0, where we'll get to redesign some quirky bits of the library, improving ease of use and flexibility. Stay tuned!

# [OpenZeppelin 2.4 (v2.4.0)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v2.4.0) - 2019-11-01

In 2.4 we're releasing support for the Gas Station Network for user onboarding and metatransactions :fuelpump:, new functions to safeguard your contracts against the Istanbul hard fork, and improvements to error messages.

Read the full announcement in the [OpenZeppelin Forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/openzeppelin-contracts-v2-4/1665), and make sure to check out the details in the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#240-2019-10-29)!

<a id="v2.3.0"></a>
# [OpenZeppelin 2.3 (v2.3.0)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v2.3.0) - 2019-06-03

In 2.3 we're introducing **ERC777**, **revert reasons**, and **a new documentation site**. :fireworks: Take a look and tell us what you think in [the announcement thread](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/openzeppelin-2-3/787)!

Take a look and tell us what you think!

### ERC777

The long awaited sequel to ERC20. Its main additions are _transfer hooks_ and _operators_. Hooks let your contracts react to token transfers. In other words, running code when a contract receives tokens is a built-in feature: no more messing around with `approve` and `transferFrom`!

The other special feature, operators, provides simpler and more flexible ways of delegating usage of your tokens to other people or contracts, like decentralized exchanges.

All of this with full compatibility with ERC20!

Start building on it and tell us what you think! We're looking for ideas for extensions, custom operators, or utilities. Share your ideas here or in a new thread.

### Revert reasons

Are you tired of running into cryptic errors like `VM Exception while processing transaction: revert`? All errors in OpenZeppelin now have proper error messages that will be displayed when you test your code! We've kept them succinct and to the point. Each error message is unique, so if you're having trouble figuring out exactly which `require` statement you've hit, it is easy to look up the error string in the source code, and look at the actual condition that is not being met.

### Documentation site

We've revamped the docs, [take a look](https://docs.openzeppelin.org)!

It'll be super helpful to both people looking to get started in smart contract development, and veteran OpenZeppelin users who just need to quickly recall a function signature. Among other improvements, we've bundled together related concepts, added overviews for each section, and added crosslinks to other contracts and functions to make exploring the docsite a breeze!

Everything is automatically generated from the comments in the source code, so if you spot a typo or have a suggestion, simply open an issue or PR to get it sorted out in no time!

_Some sections still require a bit of work to get them to where we want them to be, stay tuned!_

### More

Some more things are included in this release such as an implementation of ERC1820, and a fix for a bug in `PostDeliveryCrowdsale`. Take a look at the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#230-2019-05-27)!

<a id="v2.2.0"></a>
# [OpenZeppelin 2.2 (v2.2.0)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v2.2.0) - 2019-03-14

_No changes from the release candidate for this one, we're ironing out the kinks in the release process! :no_entry_sign: :bug:_

This minor release includes a way to store token balances and supply so that they can be later queried in a gas-efficient manner :bookmark:, allows safe interaction with some old, non-compliant tokens :lock:, prevents user errors when using ECDSA signatures :memo: (the magic behind metatransactions! :sparkles:), and provides multiple minor additions and improvements to the API.

To install the release run `npm install openzeppelin-solidity@latest`.

We would love your help by reviewing newly added contracts, their interface and documentation so that we can make names clearer, features easier to use, and the library better as a whole! Your feedback is extremely useful to us :)

## Highlights
### New features
* `ERC20Snapshot`: this variant allows for snapshots to be created on demand, storing the current token balances and total supply so that they can be later retrieved in a gas-efficient manner and e.g. calculate dividends at a past time. ([#1617](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1617))
 * `SafeERC20`: the `ERC20` standard requires that all function calls (e.g. `transfer`, `approve`, etc.) return a boolean value indicating success. However, they are multiple widely used tokens out there that return no such value: they simply `revert` when encountering an error condition. Since Solidity v0.4.22, special code was needed to interact with this non-compliant tokens: now, all of `SafeERC20` can be used to safely call both compliant and non-compliant tokens, without the developer having to worry about it. ([#1655](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1655))
* `TimedCrowdsale`: an internal `_extendTime(uint256 newClosingTime)` function was added (with a corresponding `TimedCrowdsaleExtended(uint256 prevClosingTime, uint256 newClosingTime)` event) allowing for users to safely develop mechanisms to extend the durations of unclosed crowdsales. Note that due to it being internal, there's no out-of-the-box way to do it: this feature is opt-in and must be explicitly invoked by users.

### Improvements
* `ECDSA`: `recover` no longer accepts malleable signatures (those using upper-range values for `s`, or 0/1 for `v`). This helps prevent multiple issues when using signatures as unique identifiers. Read more about common ECDSA issues [here](https://yondon.blog/2019/01/01/how-not-to-use-ecdsa/). ([#1622](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1622))
 * `ERC721`'s transfers are now more gas efficient due to removal of unnecessary `SafeMath` calls. ([#1610](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1610))

### Bugfixes:
 * (minor) `SafeERC20`: `safeApprove` wasn't properly checking for a zero allowance when attempting to set a non-zero allowance. This bug was reported independently by [@nikeshnazareth](https://github.com/nikeshnazareth). Thanks a lot! ([#1647](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1647))

### Breaking changes in drafts:
 * `TokenMetadata` has been renamed to `ERC20Metadata`. ([#1618](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1618))
 * The library `Counter` has been renamed to `Counters` and its API has been improved. See an example in `ERC721`, lines [17](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/3cb4a00fce1da76196ac0ac3a0ae9702b99642b5/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L17) and [204](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/3cb4a00fce1da76196ac0ac3a0ae9702b99642b5/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L204).

# [OpenZeppelin 2.1.3 (v2.1.3)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v2.1.3) - 2019-02-26

### Bugfix release :bug: :wrench:

A minor issue with `SafeERC20.safeApprove` was identified and reported independently by [@nikeshnazareth](https://github.com/nikeshnazareth) (thanks once again!), this release contains the correspondig fix: [OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity#1647](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1647).

This bug has been present since v2.0.0. Updating to this latest version is recommended, but no immediate emergency action should be required for production code using affected versions, due to the low severity of the issue.

These independent reviews are a great way to keep our code secure and correct: we'll be making a push for a properly funded bug bounty during these next weeks to continue encouraging them. Stay tuned!

This release was mostly the migration from Truffle 4 to Truffle 5, which should not affect end users.

The only user facing change here is removing the tests and tests helpers from the npm package. If you used the test helpers, you will now find them in the [`openzeppelin-test-helpers`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-test-helpers) package.

# [OpenZeppelin 2.1 (v2.1.1)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v2.1.1) - 2019-01-04

### 2.1 is finally out! :tada:

The most significant change is that OpenZeppelin now **works with Solidity 0.5.0**. This new release of the compiler introduced many breaking changes, and our old contracts were no longer compatible with it. After much discussion, we've decided to _drop the Solidity compiler version out of our stability guarantees_: in an attempt to both use the best possible tools and push the industry forward, our releases will target a recent compiler version, which may change between minor releases.

This means that installing this new OpenZeppelin version will require you to upgrade your compiler to the 0.5.x line, which can be easily done with the recently released [`truffle v5.0.0`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/releases/tag/v5.0.0). [The 2.0 release](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/releases/tag/v2.0.0) will be the last OpenZeppelin release with support for Solidity ^0.4.24, which we will still support in the form of bugfixes, if any are found.

In general, if you're not sure whether you'll want to upgrade your compiler version, feel free to pin an OpenZeppelin version during installation: :pushpin:

`npm install openzeppelin-solidity@2.1 --save-exact`

If you want to know more about our rationale behind this decision, and why we discarded other possible approaches, read [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/issues/1498#issuecomment-449191611).

### Highlights
 * Added `WhitelistCrowdsale`, a crowdsale where only whitelisted accounts (`WhitelistedRole`) can purchase tokens. Adding or removing accounts from the whitelist is done by whitelister admins (`WhitelistAdminRole`). Similar to the pre-2.0 `WhitelistedCrowdsale`. ([#1525](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1525), [#1589](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1589))
 * `ERC20`'s `transferFrom` and `_burnFrom ` now emit `Approval` events, to represent the token's state comprehensively through events. ([#1524](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1524))
 * `SignedSafeMath` now supports signed integers (`int256`). ([#1559](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1559), [#1588](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1588))
 * `ERC20` and `ERC721` are now more gas efficient due to removed redundant `SSTORE`s and `require`s. ([#1409](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1409) and [#1549](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1549))

The first 2.1 release will be 2.1.1, due to a minor mishap that caused a conflict in the npm registry :man_facepalming:

# [OpenZeppelin 2.0 (v2.0.0)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v2.0.0) - 2018-10-21

**OpenZeppelin 2.0 is finally here!!!**

The major feature in this release is that we are now commiting to a stable API. In the process of stabilizing we've also reviewed a lot of the existing API in order to ensure a more straightforward experience for users.

## Featuring...

### Stable API

So far OpenZeppelin's API has sometimes changed from release to release, in backwards-incompatible ways. This has enabled us to iterate on features and design ideas, but we're at a point now where we want to commit to having a stable API and delivering reliable updates.

You can expect the external and internal API of contracts to remain stable. We're only making an exception to this for the contracts in the `drafts/` subdirectory; this is where ERCs in Draft status, as well as more experimental contracts will go, and might have breaking changes in minor versions. We'll be documenting exactly what stability guarantees we provide in the coming weeks.

### Granular permissions

Features which require permissions have used the almighty `Ownable` so far. We are now moving towards a more granular system of _roles_, like the [`MinterRole`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v2.0.0/contracts/access/roles/MinterRole.sol). Just like `Ownable`, the creator of a contract is assigned all roles at first, but they can selectively give them out to other accounts.

### Improved test suite

Although this is not visible to users, we have been improving the test suite, increasing coverage to 100%, and cleaning up all of our tests, which had diverged in style. This is part of a bigger effort towards making contributing easier and involving our amazing contributors more in the entire process of building OpenZeppelin.

### A new audit

The awesome [LevelK](https://www.levelk.io/) team audited our 2.0.0 Release Candidate and they found some severe issues and suggested many improvements. We fixed almost all the issues and notes they reported, leaving only a few minor details for 2.1.0. Check out the [LevelK Audit - OpenZeppelin 2.0 project](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/projects/2) for all the details.

We want to thank [@cwhinfrey](https://github.com/cwhinfrey), [@pcowgill](https://github.com/pcowgill) and [@shanefontaine](https://github.com/shanefontaine) for their very detailed reviews, high quality standards, and human support during the closing phase of this release. This audit gave us a great confidence boost on the code that we are now publishing.

### Tons of community love

Now hold your breath, because this release was only possible because of the contributions of many, many people from everywhere in the world, and we want to thank all of them:

## Changelog

The changelog is pretty big. We are introducing new concepts and new designs, together with many renames and restructures. If you have problems, comments or suggestions, please join [our Slack channel](https://slack.openzeppelin.org/).

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/compare/v1.12.0...v2.0.0

- `Ownable` contracts have moved to role based access. ([#1291](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/1291), [#1302](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/1302), [#1303](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/1303))
- ERC contracts have all been renamed to follow the same convention. The interfaces are called `IERC##`, and their implementations are `ERC##`. Check out, for example, [`IERC20`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v2.0.0/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol) and [`ERC20`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v2.0.0/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol). ([#1252](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/1252), [#1288](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/1288))
- All state variables are now `private`, which means that derived contracts cannot access them directly, but have to use getters. This is to increase encapsulation, to be able to reason better about the code.
