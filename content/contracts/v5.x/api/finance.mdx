* [`VestingWallet`](#VestingWallet) handles the vesting of Ether and ERC-20 tokens for a given beneficiary. Custody of multiple tokens can
  be given to this contract, which will release the token to the beneficiary following a given, customizable, vesting
  schedule.

## Contracts

[`VestingWallet`](#VestingWallet)

<a id="VestingWallet"></a>

## `VestingWallet` [üìÅ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/finance/VestingWallet.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/finance/VestingWallet.sol";
```

A vesting wallet is an ownable contract that can receive native currency and ERC-20 tokens, and release these
assets to the wallet owner, also referred to as "beneficiary", according to a vesting schedule.

Any assets transferred to this contract will follow the vesting schedule as if they were locked from the beginning.
Consequently, if the vesting has already started, any amount of tokens sent to this contract will (at least partly)
be immediately releasable.

By setting the duration to 0, one can configure this contract to behave like an asset timelock that holds tokens for
a beneficiary until a specified time.

NOTE: Since the wallet is [`Ownable`](access#Ownable), and ownership can be transferred, it is possible to sell unvested tokens.
Preventing this in a smart contract is difficult, considering that: 1) a beneficiary address could be a
counterfactually deployed contract, 2) there is likely to be a migration path for EOAs to become contracts in the
near future.

NOTE: When using this contract with any token whose balance is adjusted automatically (i.e. a rebase token), make
sure to account the supply/balance adjustment in the vesting schedule to ensure the vested amount is as intended.

NOTE: Chains with support for native ERC20s may allow the vesting wallet to withdraw the underlying asset as both an
ERC20 and as native currency. For example, if chain C supports token A and the wallet gets deposited 100 A, then
at 50% of the vesting period, the beneficiary can withdraw 50 A as ERC20 and 25 A as native currency (totaling 75 A).
Consider disabling one of the withdrawal methods.

<a id="VestingWalletCliff-constructor-uint64-"></a>

### `constructor(uint64 cliffSeconds)`
*internal*

Set the duration of the cliff, in seconds. The cliff starts vesting schedule (see [`VestingWallet`](#VestingWallet)'s
constructor) and ends `cliffSeconds` later.

<a id="VestingWalletCliff-cliff--"></a>

### `cliff() ‚Üí uint256`
*public*

Getter for the cliff timestamp.

<a id="VestingWalletCliff-_vestingSchedule-uint256-uint64-"></a>

### `_vestingSchedule(uint256 totalAllocation, uint64 timestamp) ‚Üí uint256`
*internal*

Virtual implementation of the vesting formula. This returns the amount vested, as a function of time, for
an asset given its total historical allocation. Returns 0 if the [`VestingWalletCliff.cliff`](#VestingWalletCliff-cliff--) timestamp is not met.

IMPORTANT: The cliff not only makes the schedule return 0, but it also ignores every possible side
effect from calling the inherited implementation (i.e. `super._vestingSchedule`). Carefully consider
this caveat if the overridden implementation of this function has any (e.g. writing to memory or reverting).

<a id="VestingWalletCliff-InvalidCliffDuration-uint64-uint64-"></a>

### `InvalidCliffDuration(uint64 cliffSeconds, uint64 durationSeconds)`
*error*

The specified cliff duration is larger than the vesting duration.
