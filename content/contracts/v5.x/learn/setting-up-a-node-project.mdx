title: Setting up a Node project

New software industries often start out with every project sharing the same technology stack. The Ethereum ecosystem is no exception, and the language of choice is [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). Many Ethereum libraries, including OpenZeppelin software, are written in JavaScript or one of its variants.

JavaScript code is traditionally run on a web browser as part of a website, but it can be also executed as a standalone process using [Node](https://nodejs.org).

This guide will help you get your Node development environment set up, which you‚Äôll need to use the different OpenZeppelin tools and other third party products.

If you are already familiar with Node, npm and Git, feel free to skip this guide!

## Installing Node

There are multiple ways to get Node on your machine: you can get it either via a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) or by downloading [the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) directly.

<Callout>
If you are running Windows consider using [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-wsl2) as much of the ecosystem is written for Linux.
</Callout>

Once you‚Äôre done, run `node --version` on a terminal to check your installation: any [active or maintenance version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) should be compatible with most Ethereum software.

```console
$ node --version
v20.17.0
```

## Creating a project

JavaScript software is often bundled in _packages_, which are distributed via the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). A package is simply a directory that contains a file called `package.json`, describing the package‚Äôs name, version, content, and others. When you build your own project, you will be creating a package, even if you don‚Äôt plan to distribute it.

All Node installations include a command-line client for the npm registry, which you‚Äôll use while developing your own projects. To start a new project, create a directory for it:

```console
$ mkdir learn && cd learn
```

Then we can initialize it:

```console
$ npm init -y
```

Simple as that! Your newly created `package.json` file will evolve as your project grows, such as when installing dependencies with `npm install`.

JavaScript and npm are some of the most used software tools in the world: if you‚Äôre ever in doubt, you‚Äôll find plenty of information about them online.

### Using `npx`

There are two broads type of packages stored in the npm registry: _libraries_ and _executables_. Installed libraries are used like any other piece of JavaScript code, but executables are special.

A third binary was included when installing node: [`npx`](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner). This is used to run executables installed locally in your project.

Whilst [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) can be installed globally we recommend installing locally in each project so that you can control the version on a project by project basis.

For clarity we‚Äôll display the full command in our guides including `npx` so we don‚Äôt get errors due to the binary not being in the system path:

```console
$ hardhat init
hardhat: command not found
$ npx hardhat init
üë∑ Welcome to Hardhat v2.22.12 üë∑‚Äç
? What do you want to do? ‚Ä¶ 
```

<Callout type='warn'>
Make sure you are inside your project‚Äôs directory when running `npx`! Otherwise, it will download the full executable again just to run that command, which most of the time is _not_ what you want.
</Callout>

## Tracking with Version Control

Before you get coding, you should add [version control software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) to your project to track changes.

By far, the most used tool is [Git](https://git-scm.com), often in conjunction with [GitHub](https://github.com) for hosting purposes. Indeed, you will find the full source code and history of all OpenZeppelin software in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin).

<Callout>
If you‚Äôve never used Git before, a good starting place is the [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).
</Callout>

<Callout type='warn'>
Don‚Äôt commit secrets such as mnemonics, private keys and API keys to version control! Make sure you [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) files with secrets.
