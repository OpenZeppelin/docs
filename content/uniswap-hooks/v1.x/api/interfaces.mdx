## `IHookEvents` [üìÅ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v1.1.0/src/interfaces/IHookEvents.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/src/interfaces/IHookEvents.sol";
```

Interface for standard hook events emission.

NOTE: Hooks should inherit from this interface to standardized event emission.

### Events

### `HookSwap(bytes32 indexed poolId, address indexed sender, int128 amount0, int128 amount1, uint128 hookLPfeeAmount0, uint128 hookLPfeeAmount1)`
*event*

Emitted when a hook executes a swap outside of Uniswap's default concentrated liquidity AMM in a pool
identified by `poolId`, being `sender` the initiator of the swap, `amount0` and `amount1` the swap amounts
(positive for input, negative for output), and `hookLPfeeAmount0`, `hookLPfeeAmount1` the LP fees.

### `HookFee(bytes32 indexed poolId, address indexed sender, uint128 feeAmount0, uint128 feeAmount1)`
*event*

Emitted when a hook charges fees in a pool identified by `poolId`, being `sender` the initiator of the swap or
the liquidity modifier, `feeAmount0` and `feeAmount1` the fees charged in currency0 and currency1, defined by the `poolId`.

### `HookModifyLiquidity(bytes32 indexed poolId, address indexed sender, int128 amount0, int128 amount1)`
*event*

Emitted when a liquidity modification is executed in a pool identified by `poolId`, being `sender` the liquidity modifier,
`amount0` and `amount1` the amounts added or removed in currency0 and currency1, defined by the `poolId`.

<a id="IHookEvents-HookBonus-bytes32-uint128-uint128-"></a>

### `HookBonus(bytes32 indexed poolId, uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1)`
*event*

Emitted when a bonus is added to an operation in a pool identified by `poolId`, being `amount0` and `amount1` the amounts
added in currency0 and currency1, defined by the `poolId`.
