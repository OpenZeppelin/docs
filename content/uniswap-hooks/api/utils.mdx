## `CurrencySettler` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v1.1.0/src/utils/CurrencySettler.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/src/utils/CurrencySettler.sol";
```

Library used to interact with the `PoolManager` to settle any open deltas.
To settle a positive delta (a credit to the user), a user may take or mint.
To settle a negative delta (a debt on the user), a user may transfer or burn to pay off a debt.

Based on the [Uniswap v4 test utils implementation](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/test/utils/CurrencySettler.sol).

NOTE: Deltas are synced before any ERC-20 transfers in [`CurrencySettler.settle`](#CurrencySettler-settle-Currency-contract-IPoolManager-address-uint256-bool-) function.
