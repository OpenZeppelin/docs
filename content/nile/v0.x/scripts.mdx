Nile provides an API to build scripts leveraging the Nile Runtime Environment (NRE), an object exposing Nile’s functionality from compilation to account and deployment management. Nile scripts implement an asynchronous `def run(nre)` function that receives the `NileRuntimeEnvironment` object.

## Running a script

1. Create a file named `test_script.py` inside the `scripts/` directory at the root of your project with the following contents. Keep in mind that the `scripts/` directory is a suggested convention but not a requirement.

   ```python
   async def run(nre):
       accounts = await nre.get_accounts(predeployed=True)
       print("First Account:", accounts[0])
   ```

   <Callout>
   The `predeployed` parameter leverages the accounts that come already deployed with the local node. Read [get_accounts’s API Reference](nre.mdx#get_accounts) to learn more.
   </Callout>

2. Run a devnet node with `nile node`

   ```sh
   nile node
   ```

3. Run the script by using `nile run`

   ```sh
   nile run scripts/test_script.py
   ```



You can change the script’s target network with the `--network` option.

For a full reference of NRE exposed members check the [NRE Reference](nre.mdx) section.


## Useful Script Examples

In this section you can find some potentially helpful script examples.

### Declare the OZ account

Useful if you need to deploy the account in a local devnet node, for previous declaration:

```python
# scripts/declare_oz_account.py
async def run(nre):
  accounts = await nre.get_accounts(predeployed=True)
  declarer_account = accounts[0]

  # nile_account flag tells Nile to use its pre-packed artifact
  #
  # If we don't pass a max_fee, nile will estimate the transaction
  # fee by default. This line is equivalent to:
  #
  # tx = await declarer_account.declare("Account", max_fee=0, nile_account=True)
  # max_fee = await tx.estimate_fee()
  # tx.update_fee(max_fee)
  #
  # Note that tx.update_fee will update tx.hash and tx.max_fee members
  tx = await declarer_account.declare("Account", nile_account=True)

  tx_status, *_ = await tx.execute(watch_mode="track")

  print(tx_status.status, tx_status.error_message or "")
```

### Transfer funds from a predeployed devnet account

Useful for funding addresses in devnet:

```python
# scripts/transfer_funds.py
from nile.common import ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS
from nile.utils import to_uint, hex_address

async def run(nre):
  accounts = await nre.get_accounts(predeployed=True)
  account = accounts[0]

  # define the recipient address
  recipient = "0x05a0ca51cbc03e5ec8d9fad116f8737a6afe2613b3128ebd515643a1a5e5c52d"

  # define the amount to transfer
  amount = 2 * 10 ** 18

  print(
    f"Transferring amount WEI\n"
    f"from hex_address(account.address)\n"
    f"to   recipient\n"
  )

  # If we don't pass a max_fee, nile will estimate the transaction fee by default
  tx = await account.send(ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS, "transfer", [recipient, *to_uint(amount)])

  tx_status, *_ = await tx.execute(watch_mode="track")

  print(tx_status.status, tx_status.error_message or "")
```
