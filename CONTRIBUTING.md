# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the OpenZeppelin Docs! We welcome contributions from everyone.

## How to Contribute

Please follow this guide if you have something to contribute.

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement:

1. Check if the issue already exists in [GitHub issues]()
2. If not, create a new issue with a clear description
3. Wait for a team member to comment before moving forward with a pull request

### Making Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your change
3. Follow the local development guide in the [README](README.md) or with the steps [below](#development-setup)
4. Use [conventional commits]() when making changes
5. Submit a pull request

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or fix
- Write clear commit messages
- Spelling fixes should be grouped as much as possible (i.e. fixing multiple errors instead of just one)

### Development Setup

1. Make sure [Bun](https://bun.sh) is installed

```bash
bun --version
```

2. Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/docs
cd docs
bun install
```

3. Run the `dev` server to see a live preview and have your changes reflected at `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
bun dev
```
